"ChangeLog"

	* Release 0.1.2.

	* Made parser code robust to variations in yacc/bison versions, 
	  updated test expected outputs.  This was not trivial.  
	  Works on FreeBSD yacc/bison-1.875, linux yacc/bison-1.35.  

	* Minor tweaks in configuration and Makefile.am's.

	* Releasing 0.1.1, the completely GNU-ified version.  

	* Completed porting process, with slightly restructured test suite.
	  Short test scripts are automatically generated by the Makefile
	  and run by "make check".  
	  Tests are now run recursively by directory, and recursion 
	  terminates as soon as there is one failure in a directory.  

	* Considerable effort was spent getting the parser grammar files
	  to work with bison, whereas they were exclusively compiled 
	  with yacc only before.  Even test outputs were augmented
	  to account for differences between yacc and bison.

	* Took the old flattened source directory, and prepared it
	  for use with automake, autoconf, and libtool.  
	  Moving sources into subdirectories meant severing files
	  from their previous revision history, which should remain
	  in the CVS repository's Attic.
