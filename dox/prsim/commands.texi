This chapter documents the various commands available in
the interpreter.  
Commands are organized into categories.  

@strong{FYI:} the command documentation has been extracted from 
source file @file{sim/prsim/Command-prsim.cc}.

@node Built-in Commands
@section Built-in Commands

The following commands are listed in the @t{builtin} category.  

@include cmd/help.texi

The following commands give information about the state of the 
simulator and the simulated production rules.  

@include cmd/get.texi
