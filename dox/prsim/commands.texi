@chapter Commands

This chapter documents the various commands available in
the interpreter.  
Commands are organized into categories.  

@strong{FYI:} the command documentation has been extracted from 
source file @file{sim/prsim/Command-prsim.cc}.

@node Built-in Commands
@section Built-in Commands

The following commands are listed in the @t{builtin} category.  

@include cmd/help.texi
@include cmd/echo.texi
@include cmd/comment.texi
@include cmd/exit.texi

The following command is useful for showing each executed command.

@include cmd/echo-commands.texi

The following commands pertain to command aliases.

@include cmd/alias.texi
@include cmd/unalias.texi
@include cmd/unaliasall.texi
@include cmd/aliases.texi

Shell commands may be executed by prefixing a line with '!'.  
For example, @samp{!whoami}.  

@strong{New}:
Block comments are pseudo C-style, using @t{/*} and @t{*/} to enclose comments.
It is recommended to start use block-comment delimiters on their own lines
to avoid confusion.  
The line parser is very crude.
Nested comments are supported.  
Files with unterminated comments will be reported as errors.  
@t{#}-comments are allowed within block comments.  

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node General Commands
@section General Commands

The following commands are listed in the @t{general} category.  

@include cmd/source.texi
@include cmd/addpath.texi
@include cmd/paths.texi

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Simulation Commands
@section @t{simulation} Commands

@include cmd/initialize.texi
@include cmd/reset.texi

Running the simulation.  

@include cmd/step.texi
@include cmd/step-event.texi
@include cmd/advance.texi
@include cmd/cycle.texi

Coercively setting values.

@include cmd/set.texi
@include cmd/setr.texi
@include cmd/setf.texi
@include cmd/setrf.texi
@include cmd/unset.texi
@include cmd/unsetall.texi

Breakpoints.  

@include cmd/breakpt.texi
@include cmd/breaks.texi
@include cmd/nobreakpt.texi
@include cmd/nobreakptall.texi

Checkpointing.

@include cmd/save.texi
@include cmd/load.texi

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Channel Commands
@section @t{channel} Commands

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Info Commands
@section @t{info} Commands

The first subset of commands give information about the properties of the 
simulated production rules and contain no stateful information.  

@include cmd/fanin.texi
@include cmd/fanin-get.texi
@include cmd/fanout.texi
@include cmd/fanout-get.texi
@include cmd/rings-mk.texi
@include cmd/allrings-mk.texi
@include cmd/rings-chk.texi
@include cmd/allrings-chk.texi
@include cmd/what.texi
@include cmd/who.texi

The following commands give information about the state of the 
simulator and the simulated production rules.  

@include cmd/get.texi
@include cmd/getall.texi
@include cmd/assert.texi
@include cmd/assertn.texi
@include cmd/assert-pending.texi
@include cmd/assertn-pending.texi
@include cmd/queue.texi
@include cmd/assert-queue.texi
@include cmd/assertn-queue.texi
@include cmd/backtrace.texi
@include cmd/status.texi
@include cmd/time.texi
@include cmd/unknown-inputs.texi

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node View Commands
@section @t{view} Commands

View commands affect what is displayed while the simulation is running.  

@include cmd/watch.texi
@include cmd/unwatch.texi
@include cmd/watches.texi
@include cmd/watchall.texi
@include cmd/tcounts.texi
@include cmd/zerotcounts.texi
@include cmd/watch-queue.texi
@include cmd/watchall-queue.texi

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Modes Commands
@section @t{modes} Commands

This section lists commands that affect the execution of the simulation.  

@include cmd/checkexcl.texi
@include cmd/eval-order.texi

Timing mode.

@include cmd/timing.texi
@include cmd/random.texi
@include cmd/norandom.texi
@include cmd/seed48.texi

The simulator now supports @emph{weak rules} which can drive un-pulled nodes
but always yield to normal rules. 
Weak rules are marked with the @code{[weak=1]} production rule attribute.  
The use of weak-rules can be globally enabled or disabled.  

@include cmd/weak-rules.texi

@include cmd/diagnostics.texi
@include cmd/unstable.texi
@include cmd/weak-unstable.texi
@include cmd/interference.texi
@include cmd/weak-interference.texi
@include cmd/mode.texi

Two additional commands control the behavior of unstable rules.  
These are particularly useful for simulating circuits that expect to
glitch, such as synchronous (clocked) circuits.  

@include cmd/unstable-unknown.texi
@include cmd/unstable-dequeue.texi

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Debug Commands
@section @t{debug} Commands

This section is reserved for commands that are only useful for debugging
the simulator.  
Some commands that end in @t{-debug} have already been mentioned
in the other sections.  

@include cmd/check-structure.texi
@include cmd/check-queue.texi
@include cmd/memstats.texi
