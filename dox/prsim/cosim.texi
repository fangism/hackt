One may desire to run @command{hacprsim} with another simulator.
This chapter describes ways in which this can be accomplished.

@section Verilog PLI

Popular commercial tools sometimes provide an interface for
mixing simulators.  
In this section, we describe how @command{hacprsim} can be
integrated with Synopsys' VCS Verilog Simulator.  
The interface they provide is called VPI for Verilog PLI 
(Programming Language Interface).  

All of the functionality of the @command{hacprsim} is provided
in the @file{libhacktsim.la} library. 
If you've built the @HAC{} tools with shared libraries, 
then all the necessary libraries should already be available
in your installation path.  

The first step is to enable support for building a plug-in
to be loaded into the VPI.  
During the configure step, pass the option:
@t{--with-vpi=@i{/path/to/vpi/development-files}}

@example
./configure --with-vpi=/usr/local/cad/synopsys/vcs
@end example

The path should point to one directory up from 
where the C headers reside.
(Basically exclude the @t{/include} from the path argument, 
as it is automatically appended.)
@t{configure} checks for @file{vpi_user.h} in the given path.  
If it is found, then compilation will create a module for VCS's VPI,
@file{vpihacprsim.la} (which is installed with the actual @t{.so/dll/dylib}
shared library).  

@strong{Disclaimer}: the following instructions are taken from the
author's trials, and do not necessary reflect the actual
documented use.  
Consult the vendor's VPI documentation for more information.  

To enable VPI in the VCS compiler, pass @option{+vpi} to the @command{vcs}
command.  

To specify the prsim module, pass: 
@option{-use_vpiobj} @file{/prefix/lib/hackt/vpihacprsim.so}
and @option{-L/prefix/lib/hackt}.
The @option{-L} flag is forwarded to the linker used by VCS
in the final stage of compilation, and is @emph{also required} 
at run-time for finding dependent shared libraries.  
The method described here uses a dynamic library (plug-in module), 
however a static library could also suffice, as long as 
all symbols were resolved at link time.
Dependent libraries should be linked with the @option{-l} option
which is forwarded to the linker.  

VCS produces an executable @file{simv} which is dynamically
linked to @file{vpihacprsim.so}.  
If the @HAC{} libraries do not already reside in one
of the default run-time library search paths
(searched by @command{ld.so}), then you must help @command{simv}
find dependent libraries by passing the same linker flags
through @code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.

@example
sh$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/prefix/lib/hackt:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./simv

csh% env sh$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/prefix/lib/hackt:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./simv
@end example
