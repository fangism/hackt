@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Compile
@section Compile
@cindex compile

The first compile phase produces a parsed and partially checked object
file given an input text (source) file.  

@deffn Program haco [options] source object
Compile @HAC{} source to object file.
@end deffn

The source file is a text file in the @HAC{} language.  
The object file, if given, is the result of the compile.  
If the object file is omitted, the program just reports the result
of complation without producing an object file.  

Options:

@include compile/option-h.texi
@include compile/option-I-upper.texi
@include compile/option-d.texi
@include compile/option-f.texi
@include compile/option-M-upper.texi
@include compile/option-o.texi

@t{haco} is provided as a single-command alias to 
@t{hackt compile}@footnote{Thus named because we use @t{.haco} 
as the extension for compiled object files}.

@strong{TODO:} quick explanation of parse errors.  

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Create
@section Create
@cindex create

The create phase generates footprints for each complete type once, 
so that instances of the same type may share the same footprint.  
Each type's definition is sequentially unrolled and expanded 
(instantiations and connections) recursively after substituting
meta-parameter arguments.  
The input object file is the result of @t{haco}.  

@deffn Program haccreate [options] in-object out-object
Further compiles an object file through the create phase.  
@end deffn

@t{haccreate} is provided as a single-command alias to @t{hackt create}.  

All programs that normally expect object files as inputs can also
invoke the compiler on a source file with the following options.

@include compile/option-c.texi
@include compile/option-C-upper.texi

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Allocate
@section Allocate
@cindex allocate

The alloc phase expands the entire instance hierarchy top-down, 
so that every unique instance has its own state in memory.  
The input object file is the result of @t{haccreate}, 
but will automatically run @command{create} on the object file if necessary.  

@deffn Program hacalloc in-object out-object
Further compiles an object file through the alloc phase.  
@end deffn

@t{hacalloc} is provided as a single-command alias to @t{hackt alloc}.  
@t{hacalloc} supports the same options as @t{haccreate}.  

In summary, 
the create, and allocate compile phases 
automatically run the necessary prerequisite phases where needed.  
All developed tools should also implement this behavior.  


@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node File Conventions
@section Conventions

As a convention, we name our object files according to the last
phase with which it was processed or produced.  
The tools are actually extension agnostic; 
you can use whatever file extensions you like for both
source and object files.  

@itemize
@item @t{.haco} -- compiled only
@item @t{.haco-c} -- compiled and created
@item @t{.haco-a} -- compiled and allocated
@end itemize

These suffices can be used to define @t{make} rules.  
Examples of Makefile templates can be found in the distribution
@t{lib/mk} or installed in @t{@i{prefix}/share/hackt/mk/hackt.mk}.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Program Examples
@section Examples

In this section, we use the following source @file{inv.hac} 
as our input example.  

@example
defproc inv(bool a, b) @{
prs @{
  a    -> b-
  ~a   -> b+
@}
@}

bool x, y;
inv Z(x, y);
@end example

This defines an inverter process @t{inv} with public boolean ports
@t{a} and @t{b}.  
The top-level declares boolean nodes @t{x} and @t{y}, 
which are connected to the ports of instantiated inverter @t{Z}.  

A more comprehensive description of the language can be found built in
@file{dox/lang/hac.pdf} or installed as 
@file{/install/share/hackt/doc/pdf/hac.pdf}.
