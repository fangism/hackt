\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document is a usage guide for the \binhackt\ executable.  
\binhackt\ is the command to dispatch one of many programs in its 
collection of tools.  
The general usage is:

\binhackt \ttt{[}\tit{general options}\ttt{]} \tit{command}
	\ttt{[}\tit{command arguments}\ttt{]}

Currently, there are no general options to hackt, but some may
be added in the future.  
Most commands will give a brief summary of their options when 
invoked without command arguments, or when passed \ttt{-h} for help.  
Some common subprograms also have equivalent single-command aliases
that are installed by \ttt{make install}.  

TODO: write texinfo documentation and man pages...

The following topics are \emph{not} covered in this guide:
\begin{itemize}
\item language -- covered in \ttt{hac.pdf}, in \ttt{dox/lang}
\item simulators -- covered in separate guides
\end{itemize}
