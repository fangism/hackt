\chapter{The Root Object}
\label{sec:root}

(The root object is of type \ttt{ART::entity::module}.)
This chapter describes the format of the root object from which
all other subordinate objects may be reached.  

The module format is summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item string: an optional module name
\item pointer: to the global (mother-of-all) namespace.
	This contains non-sequential data for the design.  
	Namespaces are described in Chapter~\ref{sec:namespace}.  
\item bool: whether or not the module is fully unrolled
	(Is this usable by tools past the front-end?)
\item sequence of pointers: sequential instance management data, 
	used primarily by the front-end compile phases.  
	This is described in Chapter~\ref{sec:sequential}.  
\end{enumerate}

And that's all there is to it at this level.  
(Why did I reserve an entire chapter for this?)
