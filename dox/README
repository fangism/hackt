The subdirectories contain documents of various uses.

latex/ contains the Doxygen-generated code reference manual, 
	a real tree-killer and only useful for code-hackers.  
html/ contains the Doxygen-generated web-page for the code manual.
lang/ contains the ART++ (soon to be called HOORCD) language specification.
util/ contains documentation for using Fang's C++ Utility Library.
objfmt/ contains the documentation describing the intermediate object
	format used by the front-end HACKT compiler, intended as
	an interface to other developing tools.
