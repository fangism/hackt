@node Keywords
@appendix Keywords
@cindex keywords

This appendix describes some of the keywords and terminal tokens
in the @HAC{} language.
The following are all special words recognized by the lexer.  

Terminals (tokens):

@strong{TODO:} extract from @command{yacc} output file.

Keywords:

@table @t
@item __FILE__
A string that repesents the current file (absolute path).
@item __LINE__
Compile-time integer (@pint{}) that holds the current line number
in the input stream or file.  
@item import
The directive for including another source file.
Automatically ignores the file if it was already read.  
(implicit pragma-include-once)
@item #FILE
Reserved, not intended for general use.  
Embedded file directive, emitted by flattening a source file's
@t{import} directives recursively.  
Allows a single file to behave as if sections were included hierarchically.
@end table
