@quotation
"Yacc" owes much to a most stimulating collection of users, who have
goaded me beyond my inclination, and frequently beyond my ability in
their endless search for "one more feature".  Their irritating
unwillingness to learn how to do things my way has usually led to my
doing things their way; most of the time, they have been right.

This appendix describes the @HAC{} language's grammar.
The grammar is context-free and LR(1), so traditional @command{yacc}
and @command{bison} (LALR(1)) parser generators will work with it.
