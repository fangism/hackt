\chapter{Types}
\label{sec:types}

In \artxx, there are four classes of types to use:
parameters, datatypes, channels, and processes.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Parameters}
\label{sec:parameters}

Parameters differ from the others in that they don't correspond
to any physical instances; they are merely user-manipulated values.  
Currently, there are only two (built-in) parameter types: 
\pint, which is an integer value,
and \pbool, which is a boolean value.  

Parameters may be set no more than once, and they must be 
initialized before they are used.  
Using uninitialized parameters is an error.  


We cover templates more in-depth in Chapter blah.  
ART++ supports parametric types, or templates, much like C++. 
User-defined datatypes, channels, and processes may be parameterized.  
Currently the only types that may appear in template signatures
are parameters and arrays thereof.  
Later we may add support for template template arguments, muahahaha.

\section{Future extensions}
\label{sec:types:future}

Support \ttt{typeof()} operator and \ttt{sizeof()} operator.
