\chapter{Goals}
\label{sec:goals}

Designing a new language is not a task for the faint-hearted.  
There has to be sufficient motivation to justify such labor:

\begin{itemize}
\item No existing language (or composition thereof)
	meets the requirements demanded.  
\item A workaround atop of existing languages is deemed to be insufficient.
\item For fun.  
\end{itemize}

As selfish as it may seem, the \artxx\ language is designed to meet a very
specific requirement of the author.  
The author's desire is to provide a language to facilitate:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ease and effectiveness of (asynchronous) VLSI design automation
\item Ease of automatic design space exploration 
	(at high architecture level and low level circuits)
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Automation}
\label{sec:goals:EDA}

What do other languages lack?
Asynchrony?
Heirarchical information.  

When charged with the task of designing a circuit component, 
one is usually given a functional specification to meet.  
The difficulty often lies with coming up with fitting 
functional specification ---
knowing \emph{a priori} the context in which a component is used.  
Without the context in which a component is used, 
it is futile to optimize the design of that component.  
Often, one functional specification for a component is really 
meant to be used in multiple contexts, in which case, 
one would design a different version for each context.  

``Heavy-tree'' of definition uses (like calling context stacks).  

Ramble ramble ramble...

Shape and form factors...

Optimization using dynamic performance information...

\section{Design Space Exploration}
\label{sec:goals:explore}

The ultimate ambition for this project is to be able to 
automatically explore the design space of implementations of
significantly complex functional specifications.  

Program transformations.

\section{Asynchrony}
\label{sec:goals:async}

So what does \emph{asynchronous} VLSI have to do with deciding
to use a new language?  

Verilog and VHDL shortcomings...
Other existing (public) async. synthesis tools.
