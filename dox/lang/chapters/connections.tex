\chapter{Connections}
\label{sec:connections}

Connections are a relation between \emph{instance references}.  

Instance references refer to specific entities at unroll-time.  
Instance references fall into two categories: implicit and explicit.  
See Chapter~\ref{sec:arrays}.  

What does \ttt{a = b} mean in the namespace or definition context?

\begin{itemize}
\item Parameters: the value of b is assigned to a.
	This is only valid if \ttt{b} is instantiated and initialized, 
	and \ttt{a} is instantiated and uninitialized.  
\item Datatypes (both built-in and user-defined), channels and processes:
	\ttt{a} and \ttt{b} refer to the same instance, in other words, 
	they are \emph{aliases}.
\end{itemize}

If the types are user-defined, then aliasing is recursive.  
For example, if the type of \ttt{a} and \ttt{b} has 
members (either public or private) \ttt{x} and \ttt{y} internally aliased, 
the \ttt{a.x}, \ttt{a.y}, \ttt{b.x}, and \ttt{b,y} are all 
valid references to the same instance of \ttt{x} and \ttt{y}'s type.  
(Implementation:
This can simply be accomplished by mapping \ttt{a} and \ttt{b}
to the same instance, saving the trouble of recursive aliasing, 
and generating the combinations of names, 
not that that is ever a problem.)

Since connections and aliases are unrolled, the actual instance objects 
are not created until all connections have been processed.  

Compiler options (proposed to support):
\begin{itemize}
\item \ttt{-Wprocess-alias}:
	warning for connections between process
	(since the semantics seem arbitrary at this point and 
	are prone to future change), 
\item \ttt{-Wchannel-connections}: 
	warning for suspicious wrong connections with channels
	(multiple senders or multiple receivers)
\end{itemize}


Support for non-alias connections?
