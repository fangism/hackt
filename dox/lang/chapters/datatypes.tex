\section{Built-in datatypes}
\label{sec:datatypes:builtin}

Currently, \artxx\ has two built in datatypes: \bool\ and \int.  
These are not to be confused with the parameter types \pbool\ and \pint\.  
A \bool\ represents the state of a physical or electrical node.  
An \int\ is simply an array of \bool s.
