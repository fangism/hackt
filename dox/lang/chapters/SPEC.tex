\chapter{SPEC Directives}
\label{sec:spec}

This chapter describes the various directives available
in the \ttt{spec} sub-language.  

Someone should write the various spec directives up, ahem!

\begin{itemize}
\item \ttt{exclhi} --- specifies that group of nodes are 
	mutually exclusive high, i.e. only one member of he group can be
	logic high at \emph{any} time.  For simulators, this produces
	a run-time check directive.  For verifiers, like \ttt{lvs}, 
	this may help with worst-case charge-sharing analysis.  
\item \ttt{excllo} --- analogous to \ttt{exclhi} but for logic low
\item \ttt{mk_exclhi} --- coercively forces (in simulation) only
	one node of the set to be high at a time.  If a member of the
	set is already high, then it blocks the others.  
	This is useful for arbitration.  
\item \ttt{mk_excllo} --- analogous to \ttt{mk_exclhi}
\item \ttt{cross-coupled}
\end{itemize}
