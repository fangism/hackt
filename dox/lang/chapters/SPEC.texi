@node SPEC Directives
@chapter SPEC Directives
@cindex SPEC directives

This chapter describes the various directives available
in the @t{spec} sub-language.  
The following documentation is extracted from source file
@file{Object/lang/SPEC_registry.cc}.  

@ignore
@itemize
@item @t{exclhi} --- specifies that group of nodes are 
	mutually exclusive high, i.e. only one member of he group can be
	logic high at @emph{any} time.  For simulators, this produces
	a run-time check directive.  For verifiers, like @command{lvs}, 
	this may help with worst-case charge-sharing analysis.  
@item @t{excllo} --- analogous to @t{exclhi} but for logic low
@item @t{mk_exclhi} --- coercively forces (in simulation) only
	one node of the set to be high at a time.  If a member of the
	set is already high, then it blocks the others.  
	This is useful for arbitration.  
@item @t{mk_excllo} --- analogous to @t{mk_exclhi}
@item @t{cross-coupled}
@end itemize
@end ignore

Another class of specification directives is @emph{invariants}.
Invariants are conditions which should always hold true.
Invariants are useful for telling other tools what assumptions can
be made about circuits.  
@t{exclhi} and @t{excllo} are examples of invariants that use 
the normal directive syntax.  

@deffn Directive $ PRS-expr
This declares a run-time invariant expression that is emits
invariant directives to back-end tools and also tells 
simulators to check and report violations of violations, 
similar to @t{exclhi} and @t{excllo}. 
@var{PRS-expr} is a production rule guard that should #@emph{always} be true.  
@example
spec @{
  $(~(x & y))
@}
@end example
@noindent
is equivalent to @t{exclhi(x, y)}.
@end deffn
