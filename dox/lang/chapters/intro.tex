\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:intro:purpose}

What is the purpose of ART++?
What is the meaning of life?

What this IS:
\begin{itemize}
\item a hardware description language
\end{itemize}

What this ISN'T:
\begin{itemize}
\item a sequential programming language
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Roots}
\label{sec:intro:roots}
% or History

The ART++ language is based on the CAST\index{CAST}
(Caltech Asynchronous Synthesis Tool) language.  

Discuss limitations.  

The fact that this is named ART++ implies that there is or was a 
predecessor named ART.  

Religious differences, much like the
\texttt{vi} versus \texttt{emacs} holy war, 
led to a divergence of implementations and interpretations.  

(The fact that this is named ART++ is a purely jab at the original ART, 
implying that this version is in some ways superior.)
