@chapter Introduction

@command{ipple} is a physics simulator implementation of a 
general placement engine. 
@command{ipple} is part of the HACKT tool set, 
but is actually an entirely generic tool for use in any design toolchain.  
The placement engine uses various methods of mechanical simulation
to find the minimum potential energy resting state of a system.
The simulation however is user-driven and can be scripted to 
produce custom simulated annealing schedules.
