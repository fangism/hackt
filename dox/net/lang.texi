@node Language Features
@chapter Language Features
@cindex language features

Some features of the @HAC{} language were added specifically
for the sake of netlist generation.  
We briefly describe them here, but the reader is referred to
the full @HAC{} language documentation, specifically
chapters "Connections" and "PRS".

Recall that every process definition has two implicit ports for the 
power supply, @t{!GND} and @t{!Vdd}.
When unspecified, the default behavior automatically connects
transistors and subcircuits to these @emph{primary supplies}, 
hierarchically and recursively.  
There are two places where we can override these supplies.  

@c manu cross-reference to hac.info?

* Instance Supply Override:: specifying supplies for process instances

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node PRS Supply Override
@section PRS Supply Override
@cindex supply override

To override the supplies use to drive production rules 
(pull-up and pull-down) and pass-gates, we can write:

@example
prs <myVdd> @{
... @i{// These rules use myVdd to pull-up, and !GND for pull-down}
@}
prs <myVdd, myGND> @{
... @i{// Use myVdd to pull-up, myGND to pull-down}
@}
prs < , myGND> @{
... @i{// Use !Vdd to pull-up, myGND to pull-down}
@}
@end example

Rules that balong to a supply domain will use the specified supply node
for the drain of the foot transistor(s), and for the substrate (body)
terminal.  

@example
prs <myVdd,myGND> @{
  x & y -> z-
@}
// begets:
M0 myGND x #0 myGND nch W=5u L=2u
M1 #0 y z myGND nch W=5u L=2u
@end example

Normally, single-supply domain circuits need not be written
with explicit production rule supply overrides.
Instead, they can be connected externally to different supplies
when instantiated, which is described in the next section.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Instance Supply Override
@section Instance Supply Override
@cindex instance supply override
@cindex process supply override

All processes have implicit primary supply ports @t{!Vdd} and @t{!GND}, 
that are accessed differently than normal ports.  
By default, a process instance will connect its primary supply ports
to those of its immediate parent process.
To specify a different supply, one can write:

@example
bool myVdd, myGND, x, y;
inverter foo;
foo $(myGND, myVdd);
foo (x, y);

inverter yoyo(x, y);
yoyo $(myGND, myVdd);

inverter bar $(myGND, myVdd);
bar (x, y);

inverter bq $(myGND, myVdd) (x, y);
@end example

@noindent
Either supply port may be ommitted to use the corresponding 
default primary supply.  
@strong{Alert:} note that the supply ordering for instances is @t{GND, Vdd},
whereas for production rules, it is @t{Vdd, GND}.
