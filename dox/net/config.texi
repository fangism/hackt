@node Configuration Options
@section Configuration Options
@cindex configuration

There are two ways to pass configuration options to @command{hacknet}.
One is through the @option{-f} option on the command-line, 
the other way is to pass them in through a configuration file 
with the @option{-c} option.  
The option value specifications share the same syntax:
@i{key=values} where @i{values} can be blank, a single value, 
or a comma-separated list of values.  
A key-value specifier is not permitted to have spaces
in the string!

In a configuration file, blank lines are ignored, 
as well as lines that begin with @t{#} (pound).
