\section{Spec directives}
\label{sec:spec}

The \ttt{spec} sub-language in \hac\ is a generalized version
of the \ttt{spec} bodies in \CAST.  
See the SPEC language chapter in the \ttt{hac.pdf} language reference.  

Spec directives may be parameterized in \hac, 
and arguments may be passed in groups. 

\subsection{Porting from CAST}
\label{sec:spec:porting}

This section describes some common uses of spec-directives
in migrating from \CAST\ to \hac.  

\ttt{CHECK\_CHANNELS} production rules may be replaced 
with \ttt{exclhi} and \ttt{excllo} directives, 
which are used by \ttt{hackt prsim} for built-in checking
of mutual exclusion at run-time.  

Forced exclusive high/low rings, 
which used to be \emph{inside PRS} bodies, 
were declared as \ttt{exclhi} and \ttt{excllo}.  
In \hac, they are now the \ttt{mk\_exclhi} and \ttt{mk\_excllo} 
spec directives.
