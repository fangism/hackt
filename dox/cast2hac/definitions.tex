\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}

Definitions use the keywords \defproc, \defchan, and \defdata.  
The old \CAST\ keyword \ttt{define} can simply be replaced with \defproc.  

TODO: write more on newer port restrictions...

\subsection{Ports}
\label{sec:definitions:ports}

In \CAST, port declarations were allowed to be sparse, 
whereas in \hac, only dense declarations are allowed.

The following \CAST\ defintions were legal:

\begin{verbatim}
define foo(node x[1..3]) { }
define bar(node x[0..2]) { }
\end{verbatim}

However, in \hac, there is no equivalent to declaring port instances
that start with non-zero indices.  
Thus, the above definition of \ttt{foo} cannot be expressed in \hac, 
whereas the definition of \ttt{bar} could be rewritten:

\begin{verbatim}
defproc bar(bool x[3]) { }
\end{verbatim}

See Section~\ref{sec:arrays} for more on dense and sparse arrays 
and their declarations.
