@cindex instances, named
@cindex anonymous instances

@CAST{} allowed declarations of instances to be anonymous, 
which would result in automatically generated names such as @t{_a_0}.
@HAC{}, however, requires all instances to be named.  
Anonymous instances were sometimes used to declare 
arrays of a particular type without namimng the instances.
@c Now, declarations of instances must be named up front.  
(Example?)
