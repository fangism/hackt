\section{Instances}
\label{sec:instances}

\CAST\ allowed declarations of instances to be anonymous, 
which would result in automatically generated names such as \ttt{\_a\_0}.
\hac, however, requires all instances to be named.  
Anonymous instances were sometimes used to declare 
arrays of a particular type without namimng the instances.
% Now, declarations of instances must be named up front.  
(Example?)
