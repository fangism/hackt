\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\textbf{NOTE: this document is obsolete and has been superceded by
the Texinfo documentation.}

The purpose of this document is to assist \CAST\ users in migrating
old sources to the \hac\ language for use with the \hackt\ tools.  
This document assumes the reader is already familiar with the \CAST\ language
and some of its tools.  
This guide does not cover the new features of the \hac\ language; 
those are covered in the language reference.
