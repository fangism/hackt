"NEWS"

2005-01-16	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	Looks like this file hasn't been touched in a long time... oops.
	All the NEWS worth reading (and not worth) is in the ChangeLog.
	New Year's resolution: organize updates a little better this year.  

	Releasing 0.1.4.  (just a few months late...)
	Goals for this series (up to 0.1.5) are outlined in TODO.  
	The root tag for this series is ARTXX-00-01-04.  


2004-10-12

	Major rework of persistent object de/serialization framework
	completed.  Persistent types can be statically registered
	with the persistent_object_manager's global static type registry, 
	using some convenient macros.  
	This framework is now portable to any other project.  


2004-09-03

	Starting language specification documentation in dox/lang.  


2004-08-21

	Releasing 0.1.3.
	Object de/serialization complete for core classes.  
	Basic tests using diffs of textual object dumps pass.  


2004-08-19

	(still using tag ARTXX-00-01-02)
	Finished writing majority of object dump and load code 
	for many classes.  artc regression tests, which serialize objects
	in memory and deserialize to make a deep copy, all pass, 
	which only means nothing crashed and burned.  
	Goal for release 0.1.3: new set of regression tests using
	art++2obj and artobjdump to compare textual dumps
	to verify content-correctness.  


2004-08-12

	Finished GNU-ifying the entire project.  
	Everything builds correctly, the distribution is coherent and intact.  
	Make distcheck passes.  


2004-08-10

	Porting existing art++ project to use automake, autoconf, libtool.  
	Things could get ugly.  Stay tuned until the dust clears.
