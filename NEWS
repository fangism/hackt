	The HACKT project is now CVS-read-only accessible to the public
		via anonymous checkout.  See instructions:
		http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~fang/hackt/source.php#cvs


2008-11-07	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	The HACKT project is now officially GPL licensed, with many thanks
		to Cornell University for agreeing on the license.  
	A project home page has been set up:
		http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~fang/hackt/


2008-05-06	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fang has received official congratulations from the graduate school:
		he has succesfully graduated his Ph.D.!


2007-12-31	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	Over a year passes and Fang has neglected to post any news items...


2006-05-06	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	Long time no... news.
	hackt prsim is in pretty darn good shape, please start using!


2005-09-29	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	Development was interrupted for about two weeks working on ASYNC
	conference paper.  And now, back to work!


2005-07-26	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	For the first time ever, fangism is taking a vacation in the 
	summer -- a week long trip to Deustschland.  Development 
	will resume in early August.  


2005-07-24	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	Pre-screening release at tag ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-51, 
	open to our research group only for now.  


2005-04-05	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	From early March to the beginning of April, Fang has hosed
	from a conference trip and a little tapeout project, 
	the 3D-FPGA.  Being drafted into the Emergency FPGA Layout
	Expedition Task Force, he was unable to attend to art++.  
	He has now returned to active duty as art++-hacker.

	Looks like this file hasn't been touched in a long time... oops.
	All the NEWS worth reading (and not worth) is in the ChangeLog.
	New Year's resolution: organize updates a little better this year.  

	Releasing 0.1.4.  (just a few months late...)
	Goals for this series (up to 0.1.5) are outlined in TODO.  
	The root tag for this series is ARTXX-00-01-04.  


2004-10-12

	Major rework of persistent object de/serialization framework
	completed.  Persistent types can be statically registered
	with the persistent_object_manager's global static type registry, 
	using some convenient macros.  
	This framework is now portable to any other project.  


2004-09-03

	Starting language specification documentation in dox/lang.  


2004-08-21

	Releasing 0.1.3.
	Object de/serialization complete for core classes.  
	Basic tests using diffs of textual object dumps pass.  


2004-08-19

	(still using tag ARTXX-00-01-02)
	Finished writing majority of object dump and load code 
	for many classes.  artc regression tests, which serialize objects
	in memory and deserialize to make a deep copy, all pass, 
	which only means nothing crashed and burned.  
	Goal for release 0.1.3: new set of regression tests using
	art++2obj and artobjdump to compare textual dumps
	to verify content-correctness.  


2004-08-12

	Finished GNU-ifying the entire project.  
	Everything builds correctly, the distribution is coherent and intact.  
	Make distcheck passes.  


2004-08-10

	Porting existing art++ project to use automake, autoconf, libtool.  
	Things could get ugly.  Stay tuned until the dust clears.
