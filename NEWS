	(still using tag ARTXX-00-01-02)
	Finished writing majority of object dump and load code 
	for many classes.  artc regression tests, which serialize objects
	in memory and deserialize to make a deep copy, all pass, 
	which only means nothing crashed and burned.  
	Goal for release 0.1.3: new set of regression tests using
	art++2obj and artobjdump to compare textual dumps
	to verify content-correctness.

	Finished GNU-ifying the entire project.  
	Everything builds correctly, the distribution is coherent and intact.  
	Make distcheck passes.  


2004-08-10

	Porting existing art++ project to use automake, autoconf, libtool.  
	Things could get ugly.  Stay tuned until the dust clears.
