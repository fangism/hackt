"src/Object/README"

The directory tree rooted here (src/Object) contains classes and 
functions for the persistent intermediate object format used by HACKT.  
It is organized by subdirectories as follows:

common/ contains classes and definitions that are generally shared
	by several other directories, general miscellaneous useful stuff.  

def/ contains classes pertaining to type definitions, including
	template formals and port formals.  

expr/ contains classes for meta expressions (compile-time), 
	nonmeta expressions (run-time) and value references.  

inst/ classes that manage collections of instances or parameter values, 
	as well as single instances.  

lang/ classes for sub-languages supported by HACKT.  

ref/ classes for meta and nonmeta instance / value references.  

traits/ template-driven implementation policies for classes, 
	also contains built-in definitions and types of the language.  

type/ classes that contain type information, i.e. definitions
	paired with (optional) template actual expressions.  

unroll/ classes that manage the sequential playback of instantiations, 
	expression assignments, and instance reference connections.
