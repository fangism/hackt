"src/Object/unroll/README"

This class is for classes that pertain to sequential instance management, 
i.e. records that are played sequentially.  This includes instantiation
statements, expression assignments, alias- and port-connections.  

Another program phase appropriate for this directory is the
create-unique phase that establishes footprints of placeholders
for state allocation.
