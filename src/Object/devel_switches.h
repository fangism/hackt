	Module-wide preprocessor conditionals.
	Use of this file (ideally) should be confined to the Object directory.

	During development, it is often desirable to switch back and forth
	between two implementations and versions, controlled by a single
	preprocessor definition.  
	However, in production code, this file should be EMPTY, 
	and NO translation unit should depend on this i.e. do not include.
