/**
	\file "Object/devel_switches.h"
	Module-wide preprocessor conditionals.
	Use of this file (ideally) should be confied to the Object directory.  

	The sole purpose of this file is to provide a convenient
	place to include developer switches.  
	During development, it is often desirable to switch back and forth
	between two implementations and versions, controlled by a single
	preprocessor definition.  
	However, in production code, this file should be EMPTY, 
	and NO translation unit should depend on this i.e. do not include.
