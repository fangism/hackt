"src/Object/expr/README"

This directory was established to contain al the files relevant to 
meta-expressions and nonmeta (data) expressions in HACKT.  

All source file declarations and definitions reside in the ART::entity
namespace for now.  

At one time in the revision history (ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01), 
everything in here was stored in a few gargantuan headers, and 2 big honking
translation units.  fangism grew very weary of massive recompilations 
from touch one of few definitions in these massive files, so he decided
that it would be in his best interest to chop up the files into the smallest
granularity possible, and this directory was born.  Dividing up source into 
many pieces led to a dramatic speed up in recompilations during development, 
at the cost of somewhat larger binaries and slightly slower one-time compiles.  
That's the tradeoff...

In the future, this allows controllable grouping and combining of translation
units.  

TODO:
Make a quick and dirty class index, automatically for reference.
