"PR/README"
This directory is for placement/routing tool classes.
Ideally, this tool should be somewhat HAC-independent.

Parameters:

channels, channel types, connections:
spring_coefficient

objects and object types:
fixed (boolean)
size?
mass
repulsion_coefficient

connections:

obstacles:

interactive command-line interface:

Wikipedia defines:
"A fipple is a constricted mouthpiece common to many end-blown woodwind 
instruments, such as the tin whistle and the recorder."

when an attribute is type=NUM, inherit properties from channel-type[NUM]
type="string" will reference type by name
type=NUM will reference by index

graph setup:

channel-type attrs...
object-type attrs...
object attrs...
connection obj-indices... attrs...

simulation:

position-tolerance
speed-tolerance
force-tolerance
temperature [NUM]
time-step [NUM|auto]
advance [NUM]
converge

manual object manipulation:
move object position
throw object velocity

output:

export xfig, raw-coordinates, X11?, gtk?
redraw

Router program:
