# "NOTES"

Developer's Notes (transcripts of fangism muttering to himself...)

//=============================================================================
2005-04-29:
	We had a VLSI group meeting on "the big picture of tools."
	Concern: certain synthesis-class tools will want to 
	automatically generate or modify definition and instance objects.  
	How will templates complicate things?
	Think about the hooks...

//=============================================================================
2005-04-28:
	Tackling structure definition layout:
	Definition-identifiers are really references to
	concrete definition collections (in the case of templates), 
	corresponding to content layout.  
	Regarding specializations:
		I think it would be best if we avoid specializations
		at this point.  However, to plan for them in the future, 
		we should make sure that the shortcut we choose does
		not preclude partial and full specializations of definitions.  
	Regarding the hash_map of identifiers local to a definition:
		For now, without specialization is ok as is.
		Later, each specialization definition will need its own map.  
	Note however, that instantiation may be conditional, so
		each concrete definition should have its own layout map.  
	Generate these layout maps on-demand during unroll/instantiation.  
	When considering template actual parameters, 
		strict and relaxed parameters are considered equal
		and part of the distinction process.  
		It is possible for relaxed parameters to affect the
		layout of a concrete definition.  
		Consequence: many redundant and identical layouts kept...
			(this is unavoidable for semanctic correctness)
	TODO soon: update parser to accommodate relaxed and strict parameters.

//=============================================================================
2005-04-10:
	front-end:
	parser: multiple-parsers, possibly multiple-lexers
		use .yy.m4 or (cpp) for grammar snippets
	modular parser-functors
	import vs. include? support cpp directives such as #file line?
		file stacks

//=============================================================================
2005-02-17:
	TODO
	Target: 0.1.5
	After improving parser... (after second convergence -00-01-04-main-01)
	Must re-do object stack for type-checking!
		Make one stack for values and parameters, 
		another stack for physical instances, 
		and let the context restrict which one may be used!
	{chan, proc, bool, int, enum, struct, param}
	port-like connections require a generic stack, though...
	3 classes: alias, port, assign (expression)
		their uses should never mix!
	During alias-parse/type-checking, one type of list
		should "lock-out" the use of the others.  
	This will eliminate the need for any generic object list!
		And perhaps generic "objects" in general!
	In general, context interface could be more like stacktrace 
		interface: automatic stack-like management upon destruction.

2005-01-05:
CRITICAL BUG: util/memory/pointer_classes:
	some destructors (excl_ptr) use release instead of reset, 
	should be reset, HOWEVER, changing to reset() causes type-check
	phase (perhaps others) to die horrible deaths.  
Currently, leave it incorrect as release(), because in the middle of 
	other modifications (need isolation).  
	Meanwhile, littered with debug code...

Added FIX_DEBUG predefine-style switch to pointer_classes.h, 
	need to isolate the problem.  
	gdb stacktrace shows functions called with an impossible call stack!
	lookup_namespace inside check_null_template_arguments !?!?
	memory corruption?
	Worst case, may need to trace EVERY pointer_class object...
	FIXED: is safe to remove this conditional macro (2005-01-11)
	Even if ONLY sticky_ptr is fixed, there is still problem!
	Problem was failed ownership transfer leading to 
		premature deallocation, and implicit default copy-constructor, 
		which gives wrong behavior.  
	Produce (emulate) test cases?

Time to use stacktrace!

2004-12-12: Regarding unroll-time parameter resolution.

Dependencies: unroll-time type-resolution, with templates, 
	simple example being built-in datatype int<width>

Issues: need to resolve into constants, or detect error
	What kind of parameter objects do template arguments need?
	Something that can hold list of arbitrary collections, 
		guaranteed to be densely packed, but need not be implemented so.
	Currently, const_param_expr_list can only hold scalars.  
	Need an abstract placeholder besides const_param, 
		perhaps const_param_collection?
	However, we already have param_instance_collections, 
		as sparse multidimensional maps.  
	Would seem a waste to implement yet another set of arrays...

Observations:
	Assignment was already implemented as passing around flattened 
		lists of values while retaining dimensions requirements.  
		Seemed like a quick short cut to get things to work.
		We might be able to reuse this idea when "assigning"
		type parameters.  

Prerequisites: (what do I need to do...)
	For typedefs, may need a parameter value context stack.

Idea:
	An extension to passing around lists, we can implement as a
	dense vector that's arithmetically addressed, and will be 
	extensible to any number of dimensions.
	Indexed with any multikey.
	Also make a reference-array for indirection.  

//=============================================================================
regarding multikey_qmap:

	Instead of deriving in diamond-inheritance, 
	specialize multikey_qmap as a special case of multikey_map.
