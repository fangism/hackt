===============================================================================
NOTE: see util/TODO for library-related TODO
NOTE: see also sim/prsim/TODO
NOTE: see also sim/chpsim/TODO

===============================================================================
ACT-compatibility:
	option to reject processes in ports in ACT-mode (don't agree)
	PRS: transistor type arguments (needs resolution)
	port qualifiers for non-channels: (everything may read)
		'?' for read-only
		<blank> for may-write
		'!' for must-write
		* need to resolve aliases semantics ...
		?? What about structures, and bool members?
	shadow identifier conflict checking and diagnostics

===============================================================================
language expression related tasks:
	support reals (floating-point) on nonmeta language, CHP
	support strings (done for nonmeta language)

===============================================================================
sized PRS tools:
prs2spice replacement
	a way to manually size prs, using separate annotation file...
		* be able to label rules and reference literals of rule
		* be able to reference and resize rules of a particular def.
		* be able to resize rules of referenced *instances* (override)
		* be able to size rules semi-automatically depending on fanout
	far future: sprsim (sizing simulator, with self-sizing!)
		constraint solving...
	see Rajit's netgen for reference behavior

rule attributes (proposed):
	weak feedback (cross-coupled interference case)

enhancement:
	macro/spec/attribute strings need to be compressed or stored in some 
	dictionary to avoid writing identical strings out, wasting memory.
	In general, a dictionary might be appropriate for all 
		recurring strings.  Embed into persistent object manager?
		yes, give each unique string ID number.  
		Must be replayable on all platforms, so use ordered map?
		Just first-come-first-serve, construct map in object header.  
	unroll-resolving: use copy-on-write pattern for
		ALL meta-language unrolling (currently done for nonmeta)

===============================================================================
conditional instance management: (BUG, easy)
	guards need to be evaluated in sequential else-if
		(currently does NOT work)
	with sequential else-if evaluation 
		token_else should return a pbool_const(true) 
		for simplicity and avoid special casing.
	grammar guarantees that else clause may only trail
	also implement same semantics for PRS conditionals

===============================================================================
MEMORY HOG (FIXED: 00-01-04-main-00-80-45-instance-02 branch)
Summary:
	instance collection were split into placeholders
	used dense collections in addition to sparse collections
	port actual collections back-referenced port-formal collections.  
	collections are all pool-allocated PER footprint.

diagnostic statistics: (low priority TODO)
	memory self-profiling statistics from pooled-allocators, etc.

===============================================================================
preprocessor:
	Status: begun, subprogram called flatten to process imports.  
	Should accept some preprocessor compile options...
	Unfortunately, allows import declarations anywhere, not just
		beginning of the file as specified by the HAC language.  
	equivalent of compile -E with conventional compilers
	using -I include paths
	flatten the input into one file, just echoing contents recursively
	implementation: recursive reentrant lexer, 
		using unique file-manager again.
	Doesn't check grammar, just echoes input to stdout.  
	support #line directives, perhaps just // comments? (enter/leave)
	Just write a script that passes through cpp, after munging
		imports to includes and passing include flags.  

===============================================================================
PRS

production rule templates and macro types
	be able to define functions and patterns of rules for
		simple construction of buffered functions.  
	likewise be able to define and pass these trivial variations
		as compile-time arguments, macro-meta-programming.  
		template PRS can be defined in terms of these macros
		which are substituted upon instantiation.  
		e.g. celeminv_n(a,b) : a & b
			celeminv_p(a,b) : ~a & ~b
		makes for combination composition...
	need notion of unit (true) and null (false) constants.

interpret the @node semantics (whose syntax came from -PRS-07 branch)
	for internal nodes

===============================================================================
pie-in-the-sky:
	be able to define prs-macros for use in being able to 
		pass in functions into template handshaking expansions.
	INTERFACE concept, and being able to piece implementations
		together combinatorially.  (template madness)
	Be able to express compositions in terms of interfaces
		and automatically yield exponential combinations of 
		implementations.  
	Most of this is geared towards library development.  
	Already library is starting to suffer from combinational explosion. 
	One example: whether or not state-holding logic is 
		implemented with combinational feedback.  
	Language support for processes implementing interfaces, 
		and telescopic refinement.  

===============================================================================
unroll_references:
	all methods to date unroll packed references into a dense collection.
	also useful would be a way to unroll sparse or sloppy reference 
		or alias collections (e.g. prsim::getall)

value-references:
	what ever happened to mixed aggregate rvalue expressions?
	we have const_collection, and aggregate_meta_lvalue_references...

===============================================================================
command interface:
	add a "-c" command-line option to all executables 
	to use source file directly as input, instead of object file.  

===============================================================================
enums and structs
	need compile time constant meta-values
	propose: enum_const, struct_const
	using value_types: char, class datastruct_value_type
	introduce pstruct keyword to refer to meta-values?
		use as a type-prefix?

===============================================================================
channels:
built-in channel types
	implement as some kind of variadic template, with
		variable number of type arguments.  
	Maintain footprint collection of each type mentioned.  
	Is there a way to name a channel's structural member, since
		formals are not named???
built-in type footprints for allocation and tool referencing
language defect: intended to support size-types in channel declarations,
	such as "chan(bool[2])", but this was inadvertently overlooked
	in the original art grammar.  Add it back.  
	Priority: low-medium
typedefs: channel typedefs don't carry directions [!?]

===============================================================================
loop development:

lookup and value resolution:
	needs consistent resolution (currently not maintainable, copy-pasted)
	needs to check the following:
		1) is loop variable?
		2) is reference to template formal?
		3) is definition/scope-local variable (need footprint)

===============================================================================

footprint pointer persistence may be complicated in footprint_frame.
	(partially done, for top-level state)
	possibly simplify by having each footprint contain back-reference?
	(not critical, can do later...)

creation: reject unique instances that are missing relaxed actuals
	(that should have them), only after complete hierarchical merge.
	can be classified as known bug.  
	[priority bump: medium -- being used/requested]

===============================================================================
Lookup semantics: (clarifications)
	Inspired by new documentation
	lookup-member:
		always excludes the template parameters.  
		One may, however, create a value copy (alias)
			member that is equivalent to a parameter.
			*that* member should be globally visible.  
			(Enter template meta programming.)
		Although within a definition references to template
			parameters should be legal.  

	Distinction between x.y, x::y
		x.y requires x to be an instance whose type has a scope.
		x::y requires x to be a namespace or definition with scope
		(we already accomplish this, look at the test cases'
			create dumps to see where this distinction is clear.)

	lookups rooted at typedefs:
		Always use the canonical type's members.  

===============================================================================
big stuff:

*** global and out-of-scope references? ***
	Or should we restrict to passing everything explicitly?
	Suggest creating global 'structs' with relevant signals 
		and passing those.  
	Rationale: for design automation tools, all signals are treated
		as ports, be they global or local.
	Proposal: need way to detect, make implicit global ports?

CFLAT:

compare memory usage between using flattened production rule arrays
	vs. arrays of definitions (like logic gates).

in general check memory usage of large arrays of things
	make benchmarks directory.

===============================================================================
CODE HYGIENE:
	(added 20060118)
	definition classes and type-reference classes need to be
		re-implemented using class_traits.
	The current state is a pain in the a** to maintain.  
	sketch of definition traits:
		has_port_formals (port_formals_parent_type) (boolean)
		has_own_scopespace (scopespace_parent_type)
		typedef_alias_type
		is_built_in
		is_templateable
	type-reference traits: (don't expect to be many)
		base_definition_type

===============================================================================
object serialization:
	preserve source line number information for select tokens, 
	this is necessary for error reporting in later compile phases.

	Tag object files with hackt version information (signature).
	(Pass a generic header/tagging function to persistent object manager.)

endianness:
	update IO_utils' write_value and read_value specializations
		for basic types to use endianness mode to change reading.
		Writing should be in native endianness.  
	Will need to read/write a header to set the endian mode.  

hackt diff (or objdiff):
	a program to detail the differences between two object files
	differences can be structural, 
	or source-code based (debug line numbers)
	or phase differences.  
	missing objects, 
	unrolling/creating state differences, etc...

	this would be useful in determining whether or not a source
	file has changed "non-trivially."

	the crude substitute for now would be to look at the 
	differences in the textual objdump.  

	also consider implementing this as a script in combination
		with executable.  
		run unix diff first, etc...

REWORK:
	give developers option whether or not to
	derive classes safely from a common 'persistent' base?
	Is there an alternative to remove this level of inheritance? of course.
	Eventually replace current scheme with single-pass 
	serialization without having to load entire binary in memory...
	Will save considerable memory.

dictionaries:
	for strings and common value compression.  

(200601--)
Need consistency checking between different ways of generating
		intermediate object files!
	This is now possible after reworking the connection
		data structure with precisely reconstructible union-finds.  

===============================================================================
Interactive shell:
	the hackt shell
	be able to run tool commands, flow control, launch simulations, etc.
		load/mount object files, run system commands via !

===============================================================================
compile (module):
	-fdump-* flags

===============================================================================
translators:
	compile source to AST and produce sources in other languages
		such as CAST, C++ (for doxygenation) (VHDL?)

===============================================================================
HACKT template stuff:
	In the case of redeclarations, 
	how do default parameter values translate from
	forward declaration to full prototype to definition?

===============================================================================
enhancements:

Diagnostics:
	assigning already assigned variables could have more precise msg:
		(see parser/param/048.in case)

===============================================================================
parser:
	Later, check for existence of precompiled object and use that.  
	Also, need to include source information with each module,
		so later compile phases can report error's w.r.t. source.  
	Much error handling testing to be done...

	missing feature of yacc/bison-union-type.awk:
		doesn't support goto actions in the middle of grammar yet...
		will take some time to reverse-reverse-engineer my scripts...

	MEDIUM PRIORITY:
	factor out boilerplate code generated by *-union-types.awk, 
		need not be in awk source...
		Consider additional namespace scoping.  
		Can even use template.  

	Error reporting:
		Add error to context, and accumulate in a tree-like fashion.
		In general should pass error stream objects, etc...

	MEDIUM PRIORITY:
	replace the use of lexyacc_prefix.awk with a generated #define 
		substitution header.  Include that instead of transforming
		source file.  This will be needed for multi-parse/multi-lex
		compilation, and avoiding conflicts in libbogus.  

	HIGH PRIORITY: [Status: complete 20051112]
	convert generated lexers into classes:
		automatically find static table and function declarations and 
			generate a class definition!

	LOW PRIORTY: C/C++ parser to construct and manipulate syntax trees
		rather than text... more of a fun (?) side project.

	LOW PRIORITY:
		Piece together grammar snippets m4-style?

	LOW PRIORITY: (easy)
		lexical token '__TYPE__' for a type string (nonmeta?)
		token '__PID__' tor process-ID integer (nonmeta-only)

===============================================================================
LANGUAGES:
	Is there any need to support the addition of languages
		with something like @LANG { ... }?

SPEC:
	support for 'inline' attribute to flatten subinstances into 
		current definition scope (and give equivalent aliases)

PRS:
	(Virantha)
	literal attributes, like transistor sizing, but also generalized
		to key-value pairs to give transistor attributes.
		Currently, literals support expr-list arguments, 
		would need to update grammar and support in IR.  
	internal node '@' notation declare pull-down/ups
		and expansion in cflat, and other tools.  

===============================================================================
Expression resolutions:
	consider writing covariant member functions for
		many methods that implement a pure virtual base function.  
	caveat: covariant return types were not properly implemented
		until g++-3.4.x, therefore we'd have to check for
		covariant correctness during configure and work-around.
		Too much effort for now... just screw it.  

===============================================================================
DEFECT REPORTS:
to resolve: how to interpret negative indices, 
	whether or not they should be allowed, 
	along with empty expression-loops in PRS.  
	(affects several test cases in parser/prs)

interleaving of instantiations and PRS:
	prs and instances are maintained in separate structures
	Semantically, all instances are unrolled first before anything 
	is done with PRS.  Thus, there may be code that looks wrong 
	(reference before instantiation) but will not be rejected in the 
	later compile-phases.  Is this a major issue?
	Related: flow control containing PRS bodies will need to
		"duplicate" the flow control stack in PRS for proper replay.
