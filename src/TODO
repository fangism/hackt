===============================================================================
recursive create-unique! (in progress)
	done, except for private internal structures.  

footprint pointer persistence may be complicated in footprint_frame.

creation: reject unique instances that are missing relaxed actuals
	(that should have them), only after complete hierarchical merge.

===============================================================================
big stuff:

*** loops and conditionals ***

CFLAT

compare memory usage between using flattened production rule arrays
vs. arrays of definitions (like logic gates).

in general check memory usage of large arrays of things
	make benchmarks directory.

===============================================================================
enhancements:

consider using instance_collection_placeholders in definitions' scopespace.  
	(done)

introduce true resolved, canonical type references
instance collections should use them, not the fundamental derivatives

Library/Utilities:
stacktrace.h:
	add STACKTRACE_VERY_VERBOSE to include __FILE__ and __LINE__
ICE.h:
	add ICE_ASSERT combined INVARIANT with ICE macro
