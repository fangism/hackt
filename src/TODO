===============================================================================
recursive create-unique! (in progress)
	done, except for private internal structures.  

add another member to footprint to track ALL aliases, not just ports.  
	(another port_alias_tracker) evaluate all aliases, 
		and perform filtering to get port aliases.  
		Should result in much code simplification.  
		Want to keep all aliases around for fast lookup
		of all aliases at each level of hierarchy for cflat.  

footprint pointer persistence may be complicated in footprint_frame.
	(partially done, for top-level state)

creation: reject unique instances that are missing relaxed actuals
	(that should have them), only after complete hierarchical merge.

consider one more phase after create: alloc (done)

common class: dump_modifier for formatted printing and variations.  

===============================================================================
new class_trait:
	has_private_internal_structure (process only)

===============================================================================
big stuff:

*** loops and conditionals ***

CFLAT

compare memory usage between using flattened production rule arrays
vs. arrays of definitions (like logic gates).

in general check memory usage of large arrays of things
	make benchmarks directory.

===============================================================================
enhancements:

consider using instance_collection_placeholders in definitions' scopespace.  
	(done)

introduce true resolved, canonical type references
instance collections should use them, not the fundamental derivatives

Library/Utilities:
stacktrace.h:
	add STACKTRACE_VERY_VERBOSE to include __FILE__ and __LINE__
ICE.h:
	add ICE_ASSERT combined INVARIANT with ICE macro
