PRS: in cflat
	3) test cases instantiating processes with PRS, hierarchically!!!

PRS parser needs to support rule loops...
	need to extend intermediate form in Object/lang/PRS.  

footprint pointer persistence may be complicated in footprint_frame.
	(partially done, for top-level state)
	possibly simplify by having each footprint contain back-reference?
	(not critical, can do later...)

creation: reject unique instances that are missing relaxed actuals
	(that should have them), only after complete hierarchical merge.
	can be classified as known bug.  

===============================================================================
new class_trait:
	has_private_internal_structure (process only)

===============================================================================
big stuff:

*** loops and conditionals ***
*** global and out-of-scope references? ***

CFLAT

compare memory usage between using flattened production rule arrays
	vs. arrays of definitions (like logic gates).

in general check memory usage of large arrays of things
	make benchmarks directory.

===============================================================================
Library stuff:
util: use new ptrs_functional_proposed.h with const_traits.h

===============================================================================
enhancements:

consider using instance_collection_placeholders in definitions' scopespace.  
	(done)

introduce true resolved, canonical type references
instance collections should use them, not the fundamental derivatives

Library/Utilities:
stacktrace.h:
	add STACKTRACE_VERY_VERBOSE to include __FILE__ and __LINE__
ICE.h:
	add ICE_ASSERT combined INVARIANT with ICE macro

===============================================================================
Simulation:
	generate process_entries' unrolled production rules!
		only needed for simulation, not flattening [PUNT]
		state information of expressions not needed yet

===============================================================================
PRS and CHP

pass-gates:

KNOWN BUGS

test cases:
parser/connect/120.in, 121.in
	regarding hierarchical propagation and checking of relaxed actuals
