Hierarchical connections:
	Instance aliases with relaxed actuals may have NULL actuals
	only if they are connected to a port.  Internal instances
	must be strictly specified.  
	(see test cases: connect/116,117,120,121)

	For simplicity, aliases of relaxed types should be explicitly
	connected into a single alias ring (flat) because of the
	new method for symmetrically merging rings and the 
	strict equivalence requirement between aliases (explicit
	or hierarchical).  

Global references from with definition-scopes:
	Out-of-scope references are simply not implemented yet, 
	which means, everyhing should be passed in through
	public ports or template arguments.  
	Currently, the compiler bombs because I haven't bothered to
	trap out-of-scope references yet.  
	TODO: make it at least catch such references and just error-out.  
	Example case: param/049

Relaxed actuals:
	Since strict parameters may not depend on relaxed parameters we 
	must keep track of the *origin* of values, like a poison bit
	per value.  This will prevent relaxed parameters from leaking
	to places where their use is forbidden.  
	(see test cases: template/056,057)
