guile: [CRITICAL]
	This is an issue primarily with guile.
	guile uses C-style exception handling with setjmp/longjmp, 
	which screws up proper stack unwinding and destruction of local objects
	consequence: errors during guile will leak resources like crazy
	Issue has been raised on guile-users@gnu.org.
	Propose to re-implement their exception mechanism.

getopt: is not re-entrant on most platforms, and is not required to be
	by the POSIX standard.  getopt has side-effects on internal state
	and thus cannot be used in a nested manner, as needed by
	nested command line option parsing (forwarding compile driver flags).
	TODO: replace with own nicer version.

editline: 2006-07-09
	piping or redirecting script into editline-histedit
		doesn't terminate properly on end-of-file/stream.
	workaround: pass the -b flag (batch mode, non-interactive)
		to bypass editline.

Hierarchical connections:
	Instance aliases with relaxed actuals may have NULL actuals
	only if they are connected to a port.  Internal instances
	must be strictly specified.  
	(see test cases: connect/116,117,120,121)

	For simplicity, aliases of relaxed types should be explicitly
	connected into a single alias ring (flat) because of the
	new method for symmetrically merging rings and the 
	strict equivalence requirement between aliases (explicit
	or hierarchical).  

Global references from with definition-scopes:
	Out-of-scope references are simply not implemented yet, 
	which means, everything should be passed in through
	public ports or template arguments.  
	Currently, the compiler bombs because I haven't bothered to
	trap out-of-scope references yet.  
	TODO: make it at least catch such references and just error-out.  
	Example case: param/049

DEFECT:
lookup:
	Since global namespace is anonymous, there no way of 'open'-ing
		it from a sub-namespace, e.g. when wanting to change
		lookup precedence.  

expression-lists with optional rvalues (e.g. function/template arguments)
	potentially ambiguous interpretation of foo<>:
		0 template arguments vs. 
		1 template argument expecting default value
	proposal: favor the latter
	conflict: <> has special meaning in the context of relaxed types
		with 0 strict template arguments.

Relaxed actuals interaction with typedefs:
	completely borked, see parser/template/env_source_typedef* test cases.

Relaxed actuals:
	This may no longer be relevant (2007-07-17):
	Since strict parameters may not depend on relaxed parameters we 
	must keep track of the *origin* of values, like a poison bit
	per value.  This will prevent relaxed parameters from leaking
	to places where their use is forbidden.  
	(see test cases: template/056,057)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOT BUGS:

memory leak false positives:
	valgrind will report that memory allocated from hash_map is not
		deallocated because it is actually managed through a pool.
		This is not a problem.  See note in Object/common/scopespace.h.
	memory allocated by readline in history buffer:
		I have no idea how to reclaim.
	flex lexers' buffer [one-time leak, not critical, but FIXED anyways]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLOSED BUGS:

minor detail in type information dumping:
	parser/connect/130.hac
	port dump of definition should at least contain dimensionality
		of collection (type^dim), but is missing.  
	is probably to be fixed in port_manager's call to 
		instance_collection::dump or dump_collection_only.
	status: FIXED

readline and command-line interpreters: (2006-03-29)
	readline eats '\t' characters, duh!
	solution: non-interactive script interpretation should
		use getline() over readline() to preserve these.  
	For prsim, explicitly use the -b flag when redirecting a script in.
	(Program cannot tell difference between redirected and interactive
		stdin input...)
	status: FIXED (same day)
