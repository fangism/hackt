Nothing really *needs* to be done in here.
This is more of a wish-list for the util/ directory.  

===============================================================================

===============================================================================

Tired of gargantuan object files and executables with 
grossly-replicated inlined template code?  
Your compiler doesn't support *gasp* export template?

Make set of headers to split STL headers into:
	1) a forward declarations header (_fwd.h)
	2) a class definition header (.h)
	3) a template method definition (.tcc)
These files should go in a subdirectory, perhaps "STL"?

Issues: may have to copy-fudge standard headers
	and hack the #define's to check for inclusion.

Possible convention:
#define inclusions to intentionally interfere with STL headers.  
	Very hackish and not portable across compilers / versions.

hash_qmap, qmap: replace inheritance from hash_map and map
	and wrap-adapt instead (containership).  
	Will be some hassle of replicating/wrapping every public method...
	But I feel it's worth it.  

Do this with hash_qmap, qmap, multikey_qmap, etc. first to see benefit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
persistent_object_manager:
	upon exception thrown during load_objects, 
		properly delete all transients and rethrow, 
		to prevent bogus memory leak on exception. 

	Alternative to deriving everything from class persistent:
	write a proxy class to manage the object lifetime
		saving and reconstruction.  
	virtualize these proxy classes instead of the classes themselves.
	reduces invasiveness by not requiring direct inheritance
		from class persistent, but uses template polymorphism
		to implement a certain interface.  
		(reference: see how AST::node was removed from hierarchy)

	(20060319)
	persistence is really slow and memory hogging because:
	1) pointer collection traversal touches many pages
	2) all objects binaries are stored in reconstruction buffers
		before being written out to memory, doubling mem. footprint.
	Proposal:
	a) write binary objects to temporary buffers only and
		stream binary out to temporary file, then concatenate
		with header.
	b) consider writing/collecting objects in one single pass?
		construct separate header on the fly?
	Consider dictionary support for common small object values
		such as strings and integers, to avoid replication.  
		(classification: enhancement)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding memory pools:

	* Type-agnostic versions of pools that allocate pure blocks of memory, 
	  based on requested size (sizeof()).  
	  Set of explicit template instantiations to "cover" the needed sizes.
	  Goal: reduces unnecessary template code replication.  
	  Safe use of reinterpret_cast, just as with std::allocator.  

	* Reclamable memory pools, reclaim contiguous blocks of memory.  
	  Like list_vector_pool, but with ability to release empty blocks.  
	  List_vector_pool is only good for recycling, but not reclaiming.  

	* Reclamable pools with FIFO or LIFO replacement deallocation.  


In "list_vector.*":

	Implement insertion and deletion with vector fragmentation, 
		and map management.  

	Possibly track bit-map of free-indices?
	May need bit-manip adaptation or library...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding pointer-classes:
	Files: excl_ptr.h, count_ptr.h
	Migrate into the memory/ subdirectory. (DONE)
		-- renamed "pointer_classes.h"
	Overhaul to eliminate inheritance from abstract_ptr. (DONE)
		(That was just an experiment.)
	Implement pointer_traits concept, just like iterator_traits.
		(partially done)
	Combine pointer classes with const- counterparts to unify, 
		eliminate replication.  (DONE)
	sticky_pointer: can acquire ownership, but never transfer it, 
		useful for containers, replacement for some_ptr.  
		(partially done)
	unique_pointer: transferrable ownership, but not replicable, 
		not even by never_ptr.  
		(barely started)
	(Migrating from old-style to new will be painful...
		better get it over with AQAP.)
		(DONE)

	allocate size_t reference counts with fast allocator, 
		like list_vector_pool.

	what about allocator_traits?

write a series of tests exhausting ALL combinations of copy, transfer, 
	assignment for ALL pointer-classes!
	Use STL containers.
	Expect invariants everywhere.

util: use new ptrs_functional_proposed.h with const_traits.h
	status: somewhat tested, ready to use

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

vectorization:
	See what valarray does already...
	File: aligned_vector.h
	Create it!
	Guarantees that memory access are aligned to specified boundary, 
		by padding the head of the vector.  
	Useful for vector arithmetic.  


	(not important)
	File: reserved_vector.h
	Constant capacity container, can be full.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

algorithms:
	File: optimized_algorithm.h
	Implement unrolling algorithms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

integer types:
	defined one_indexed_size_t and zero_indexed_size_t
	with automatic implicit conversions between them.  
	rationale: keep from having to remember or lookup documentation
		on what the f--- is 1-indexed and 0-indexed.  
		Self-documenting code!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
numeric:
	for fun:
	primality...
	compile-time taylor expansion and evaluation of constants...
	doh, can't pass floats as template arguements... yet

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
debug utils:
	File: stacktrace.h
		add STACKTRACE_VERY_VERBOSE to include __FILE__ and __LINE__
	status: easy-to-do

===============================================================================
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
DONE
	(so we have some sense of accomplishment)

regarding pointer-classes:
	persistent_object_manager to take advantage of 
		pointer_traits and pointer_classes.  (done)
	Make it a friend class to pointer_manipulator.  (done)
