# "src/util/ChangeLog"

2005-07-05	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-06-actuals-14:
	  Added "util/reserve.h" policy for vector-like memory reserve
		when possible -- for other non-vectors, it no-ops.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-06-actuals-10:
	  Fixed scalar initialization bug in util::multikey_generic, 
		where passing in 0 dimension would result in
		allocating size_t(-1) size array in constructor. 
		Moral of lesson: look before you subtract one.  
		(Updated bunch of multikey_generic's constructors)
	  Fixed multikey_generic assignment (=) bug:
		default assignment semantics for valarray (implementation type)
		are insufficient: defaults to truncated copy.
		We replaced with proper reallocation (vector-style)
		assignment, with explicit destruction and placement
		copy-construction.  
	  Eliminated copy-modified specialization of packed_array<bool>
		and replaced it with a packed_array_implementation
		policy class, with specialized types for bool case.  
		Result: much code reduction for equivalent functionality.
	  Updated pretty-print dump for all packed_array*.
		Includes a nice multidimensional array dump.  
	  Also added a test to packed_array_test to check for this.  
	  While I was at it, replaced iterator initialization
		with construction where possible in util::multikey*
		and util::packed_array*.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-06-actuals-07:
	  Added explicit instantiation macros to "util/multikey.tcc".


2005-06-21	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-06-actuals-02:
	  Figured out how to automatically generate unique identifiers
		using cpp, after discovering macro tricks on the web.  
	  "util/indent.h" and "util/stacktrace.h" now use these macros.
	  No more shadowing identifier conflicts!  Hallelujah!


2005-06-21	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-45-merged-anal-04:
	  Merge to trunk.  


	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-44-anal-04:
	  Tiny patches after cross-checking against different gcc versions
		on different platforms.  

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-44-anal-03:
	  Updated a bunch of files to conform to new warning strictness, 
		describe in src/ChangeLog (same entry).
	  persistent_object_manager's indices have been updated to
		size_t (unsigned int) type.  


2005-06-20	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-44-anal-02:
	  Every util/.tcc file has been updated with the following
		macros for controlling template instantiation:
		EXTERN_TEMPLATE_<file-name>
			predefine to suppress template method definitions
			and only include the .h header of the same class(es).
		EXCLUDE_DEPENDENT_TEMPLATES_<file-name>
			predefine to exclude the template definitions
			that this file/class depends on.  
	  By default, when the user does nothing different, all dependent
		definitions are included recursively in .tcc files.  
		So If you don't even think about it, it just works.  
	  We now explicitly suppress template instantiation by *hiding*
		the complete template definition when the above macros
		are used.  Since -pendantic was added to the compiler 
		dialiect flags, replace "extern template" with these
		macros.  
	  Caveat: There can be cross-interactive effects between 
		multiple .tcc files that share the same dependencies, 
		so be warned.  You can always diagnose a problem
		by using -save-temps and examining the .ii files.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-19:
	  Provided INDENT_SOURCE() macro in "util/indent.h".


2005-06-08	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-09-dataexpr-10:
	  Adding -Wundef to CFLAGS caught an unremoved obsolete conditional
		in "util/packed_array_fwd.h", harmless, but fixed.  


2005-06-06	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-09-dataexpr-06:
	  util/memory/ref_count_pool.h:
		removed cyclic header dependence on count_ptr.h, 
		replacing with forward declarations.  


2005-05-23	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42:
	  ptrs_functional.h: relocated to util namespace, not std anymore.  


2005-05-22	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-39:
	  Modified and verified that all headers properly standalone.
		(except using{i,o}stream.h, which aren't supposed to be.)
	  Anything that directly depends on the definition of size_t
		now includes configure-dependent "util/sizet.h".
	  Split out forward declarations of persistent.h into separate file.  


2005-05-20	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-38:
	  Started this ChangeLog.
	  From now on, util-library related changes should be noted here.  
	  getopt_portable.h:
		now uses conditional results of configure script in config.h.  
	  static_trace.h:
		added DEFAULT macros for convenience, now don't have to
		pass in string argument for BEGIN and END, 
		defaults to using built-in __FILE__.
