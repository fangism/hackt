	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42:

2005-05-22	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-39:
	  Modified and verified that all headers properly standalone.
		(except using{i,o}stream.h, which aren't supposed to be.)
	  Anything that directly depends on the definition of size_t
		now includes configure-dependent "util/sizet.h".
	  Split out forward declarations of persistent.h into separate file.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-38:
	  Started this ChangeLog.
	  From now on, util-library related changes should be noted here.  
	  getopt_portable.h:
		now uses conditional results of configure script in config.h.  
	  static_trace.h:
		added DEFAULT macros for convenience, now don't have to
		pass in string argument for BEGIN and END, 
		defaults to using built-in __FILE__.
