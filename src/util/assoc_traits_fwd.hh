	implementation.
	Also contains a few other useful traits in typedefs.  
	This is required, because access to the internals of stl_tree's
	_Rb_tree are protected.
	For every associative container you create that needs this trait, 
	you'll need to define a partial specialization.  
	No default definition is provided intentionally.  
	We provide partial specializations here for STL containers.  

	Specializations should define a typedef selector, referring to 
	one of the above standard slectors, or similar type.
