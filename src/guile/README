<QUOTE>
Because it's easier to maintain documentation, code, and other metainfo
in one source file than in many files, there have evolved many methods
for grepping source to lift and separate these kinds of info, in the
process generating docs or fragments of source or what have you.  This
is known generally as "snarfing", which comes from the verb "to snarf",
here meaning "to unceremoniously extract information from a somewhat
unwilling source."
