"ChangeLog"

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-01:
	  Updated parser to extend template formal signature to 
	  include (optional) list of relaxed parameters.  
	  In transient state: currently type-checking treats
	  both formal lists as one unified list, even though it is now
	  implemented as a pair of lists in the AST.  
	  The definition structure has not been updated yet.

	* ART::entity::scopespace is no longer : virtual public object, 
		and ART::entity::namespace is : public object.
		(rationale: simplified class heirarchy somewhat.)

	* ART::entity::definition_base no longer inherits from
		public object virtually.  

	* Started this ChangeLog for more details.
