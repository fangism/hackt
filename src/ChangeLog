	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-02:
	  Substituted old template_formals_list and _map in definition_base
	  with a template_formals_manager (basically wrapper around the former)
	  and split up single formal parameter list into a 
	  strict list and relaxed list.  
	  Many definition_base method calls now just wrap around calls
	  to template_formals_manager methods.  
	  As a consequence, the binary format of all definitions
	  has been extended by one pointer-list.  
	  Since none of the current test-cases use relaxed parameters, 
	  the object sizes (per definition) were increased by 4 bytes, 
	  the sizeof(size_t) for '0' representing an empty list.  

		+ Some type-check error messages have been improved.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-01:
	  Updated parser to extend template formal signature to 
	  include (optional) list of relaxed parameters.  
	  In transient state: currently type-checking treats
	  both formal lists as one unified list, even though it is now
	  implemented as a pair of lists in the AST.  
	  The definition structure has not been updated yet.

	* ART::entity::scopespace is no longer : virtual public object, 
		and ART::entity::namespace is : public object.
		(rationale: simplified class heirarchy somewhat.)

	* ART::entity::definition_base no longer inherits from
		public object virtually.  

	* Started this ChangeLog for more details.
