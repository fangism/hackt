"ChangeLog"

2005-05-14	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-02:
	  Added initial skeleton classes for PRS objects.  
		Fill-in-the-blanks soon.  
	  Some util library stop-tweaks: persistent_object_manager
		now tracks raw_pointer read-visits separately, 
		added collect_pointer_list template method.


2005-05-14	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-01:
	  This branch is for early development of PRS management.  
	  The initial revisions do some clean-up with a few parsers'
		check_build routines; they are still functionally ugly.  
		Beginning to make check routines consistent using more
		CHECK_PROTO macros to keep things straight (e.g. type_base).  
	  node_list has a new check_list template method
		that allows one to specify which element's member function
		to invoke recursively.  We intend to eliminate all generic
		calls to check_build accordingly.  


2005-05-13	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-07:
	  All cleaned up, and ready to merge back to main trunk!
	  All obsolete code involving expr::check_build... GONE.  
	  No trace of object_list remains, nor any of the 
		evil associated therewith.  


2005-05-13	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-06:
	  Pretty much done amputating:
	  entity::object_list is practically eliminated, Gott sei dank!
	  parser::context's object stack is gone.  
	  parser::expr::check_build (and friends) has been phased out.  
		(All conditionally commented out HAVE_EXPR_CHECK_BUILD.)
	  No longer instantiating node_list<const expr>.
	  Eliminated unused class parser::connection_argument_list.
	  Updated calls to check_build to use check_expr and check_reference,
		mostly affecting "AST/art_parser_instance.cc".
	  Upgraded parser::connection_statement's lvalue to inst_ref-expr*.  
	  It's all coming together... now just have to clean up
		the mess of comments and obsolete code.  


2005-05-13	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-05:
	  Continued gradual elimination of expr::check_build (and friends).  
	  Removed inst_ref_expr::check_build().
	  Moved alias_list::postorder_check to expr_list, along with a few
		other useful static functions.  
	  New method for actuals_base::check_actuals, replacing check_build.
	  Added replacement methods for instnace_connection, and 
		connection_statement, calling new check_actuals.  
	  entity::definition has new prototype for certify_port_actuals, 
		process_definition::... has updated definition.  
	  Ported object_list::make_port_connection to 
		connection_statement::make_port_connection (static).
	  parser::actuals_base no longer derived from instance_management.  
	  parser::connection_statement now derived from instance_management.  
	  Partially cleaned up some obsolete code, but there'll be more
		deletions in the next revisions, I promise.  


2005-05-12	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-04:
	  Added expr::check_generic (virtual) to present the result of
	  check_expr or check_reference dynmiacally cast to the other type, 
	  solely for the purposes of working with alias_list's checking
	  procedure.  (read: kludge, but less than it was before)
	  id_expr and member_expr primary check method is now check_reference.  
	  Added placeholder check_generic routines to array_concatenation, 
	  loop_concatenation, and array_construction.  
	  (Will need to add check_reference routines once we start 
	  implementing them.)
	  Updated alias_list::check_build to use check_generic, 
		and moved object_list make_param_expr_assignment
		and make_alias_connection methods into private methods.  
	  Updated token_identifier to use check_reference.  


2005-05-12	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-03:
	  Checked implementation of check_expr, check_reference, 
		check_indices, check_ranges and fixed minor bug 
		since last revision.  
	  Replaced calls to [dense_]range_list::check_build()
		with check_ranges and check_indices where appropriate:
		formal_id's, instance_array.  
	  One problem: check_expr returns param_expr, whereas
		check_reference returns instance_reference_base, 
		both of which are 'objects'.  alias_list is a list of
		expr, but wants generic objects to determine at type-check
		time whether it is forming an expression assignment
		or alias connection sequential instance management item.  
		Thus, we cannot eliminate the object stack (nor calls to
		expr::check_build) until this is resolved.  


2005-05-11	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-02:
	  Implemented expr::check_expr (pure virt.) by mostly trivially
		copying over the old check_build's.  
		Intend to phase out expr-related check_build calls in
		favor of check_expr.  
		check_index, check_ranges, etc. are analogous.  
	  Minor: split off range and range expr into own AST source file.  
	  Minor: permanently erased paren_expr class.  
	  Minor: inst_ref_expr class to sub-type expressions that
		represent instance or value references, adds a virtual
		function check_reference, which will leverage the work
		done by check_expr (or vice versa).  
	  Minor: removed class postfix_expr (was useless).
	  Minor: continued to strip out useless tokens in the AST, 
		also cleaning grammar.  


2005-05-10	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-01:
	  This branch is intended to rework the way expression checking
	  is done by the parser, replacing the archaic check_build
	  in an orderly manner with object-specific interfaces and routines.
	  In particular, this branch deals with expression checking.  
	  The main goal is to delete the old context::object_stack mechanism
	  used to construct hierarchical expression objects.  
	  This first revision deleted the useless parser::postfix_expr class.  
	  As a result, parser::index_expr is directly derived
	  from parser::expr.
	  After this branch is complete, we can work on fixing
	  type-references (w.r.t. strict and relaxed templates) in
	  a cleaner fashion.  


2005-05-09	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35 (main trunk):
	  Major organization for sake of code maintainability:
	  Eliminate CPPFLAGS -Iblah.  Include files relative to 
	  root path of source tree, i.e. with Object/ or util/ or AST/...
	  Motivation: reduces code obfuscation, by letting the casual
	  reader know where to find dependent files, rather than counting
	  on knowing which subdirectory each included file belongs in.  
	  Also cleaned up some obsolete code in util/ directory, 
		reducing almost 2000 LOC.  


2005-05-09	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-34 (main trunk):
	  Cleaned up old hash_string code (useless).  
	  Improved some expr/inst_ref dump code to be more verbose, 
		qualifying names of value-references.  


2005-05-08	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-33 (main trunk):
	  Cleaned up conditional code
	  (should've been committed in -template-01 branch).
	  Also removed some dusty obsolete code snippets.  


2005-05-04	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-30 (main trunk):
	  Updated parser/try_lex_catch.awk to also work with yacc output.  

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-28-merged-template-01-09 (main trunk):
	  Merged -template-01 revisions back to trunk.  

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-09:
	  Clean up of previous release: expurgated ART::parser::node!


2005-05-03	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-08:
	  It is done.  ART::parser::node (and all its evils) have been phased
	  out, in favor of a cleaner token class heirarchy.  
	  Not a single test broke!
	  This revision has commented out the evil, next revision will
	  clean up.  


2005-05-03	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-07:
	  Auto-generated parser helper code (union) no longer needs to 
	  return a mother pointer (node*).  
	  It 'virtually' implements the two neceessary functions in two
	  giganormous function pointer tables (delete, what_where).  
	  (A virtual virtual call!)
	  Soon, going to remove ART::parser::node!


2005-05-03	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-06:
	  Parser awk scripts: factored out common subroutines into
	  separate scripts, so now need to invoke awk -f with co-dependent
	  scripts.  This reduces duplicate maintenance on these files, 
	  which will soon be modified, at the cost of having to keep around
	  more script files.  


2005-05-02	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-05:
	  Updated grammar to include instance type completion, 
	  where array instances may have their types completed
	  with relaxed template arguments (after array is declared with 
	  strict template arguments).  
	  (Includes type_completion + connection statement.)
	  check_build for these new classes is yet unimplemented.
	  GRAMMAR UPDATE: removed semicolon after namespace close-brace.
	  Not keeping around silly semicolons in AST structures, 
		deleting useless tokens immediately in parser.  
	  Tests updated accordingly.
	  TODO: re-update all tests with YACC=/usr/bin/yacc configuration.  
		(been forgetting to do this for a long time...)


2005-05-02	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-04:
	  Updated ART::parser::node_list::what() message (and test cases).
	  Created class ART::parser::template_argument_list_pair, but unused.
	  Added util/type_traits.h for convenience and compatibility.  
	  Some more parser implementation notes in src/parser/NOTES.  
	  Standardized header inclusion in parser/{yacc,bison}-union-hack.awk.


2005-05-01	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-03:
	  Parser context now adds template formals to either the 
	  strict parameter list or the relaxed parameter list.  
	  Some minor re-organization to reuse code in template_formals_manager.
	  TODO: Type-references template arguments need to be split into
	  strict and relaxed.  


2005-04-30	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-02:
	  Substituted old template_formals_list and _map in definition_base
	  with a template_formals_manager (basically wrapper around the former)
	  and split up single formal parameter list into a 
	  strict list and relaxed list.  
	  Many definition_base method calls now just wrap around calls
	  to template_formals_manager methods.  
	  As a consequence, the binary format of all definitions
	  has been extended by one pointer-list.  
	  Since none of the current test-cases use relaxed parameters, 
	  the object sizes (per definition) were increased by 4 bytes, 
	  the sizeof(size_t) for '0' representing an empty list.  

		+ Some type-check error messages have been improved.  


2005-04-28	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-01:
	  Updated parser to extend template formal signature to 
	  include (optional) list of relaxed parameters.  
	  In transient state: currently type-checking treats
	  both formal lists as one unified list, even though it is now
	  implemented as a pair of lists in the AST.  
	  The definition structure has not been updated yet.  


2005-04-18	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ART::entity::scopespace is no longer : virtual public object, 
		and ART::entity::namespace is : public object.
		(rationale: simplified class heirarchy somewhat.)

	* ART::entity::definition_base no longer inherits from
		public object virtually.  

	* Started this ChangeLog for more details.
