"ChangeLog"

2005-05-28	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-08:
	  Purged all traces of parser::context::definition_stack.
	  New class: old channel_type_reference was split off into
		builtin_channel_type_reference and channel_type_reference, 
		with common parent channel_type_reference_base.
		(Will soon rename channel_type_reference 
		to user_channel_type_reference.)
	  builtin_channel_type_reference just contains a list of 
		data_type_reference (pointers), which represents channel
		types of the form "chan(type,...)" without having a 
		builtin_channel_definition.  
	  The base channel type of a user-defined channel has been reduced
		to a builtin_channel_type_reference.  
	  entity::user_def_chan now contains (pointer) 
		builtin_channel_type_reference.  
	  Moved some parser functionality around to follow changes
		in the channel_type_references.  
	  Updated class_traits<channel_tag> in 
		"art_object_classification_details.h"
		Never before have I been so happy that I did this -- 
		what would've been days of changing code across tens of
		files was accomplished with TWO line changes in the 
		policy classes.  Also added new sub-tags of channel_tag
		in "art_object_classification_tags.h" but not used yet, 
		until we decide to split off channel_tag.  
	  Type hash keys for channel type references updated.  


2005-05-28	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-07:
	  Reorganized parser type references to fit the needs of channels.
	  The basic issue is that built-in channel types (chan(...)) 
		currently have no home scopespace, therefore we must
		work their type information into
		"built-in-channel-type-references", which are coming soon.  
	  TODO: split up channel type references into built-in and
		user-defined (currently, only user-defined).
	  parser::context: phased out definition_stack, which was once
		used as a placeholder to construct complete type references.  
	  concrete_type_ref now an abstract class, the old functionality
		has been pushed down to (new) generic_type_ref.
	  chan_type now derives from concrete_type_ref, no longer type_base.
	  generic_type_ref::check_build has been phased out due to
		abandoning the context definition_stack.  
	  typedef_alias::check_build base type is concrete_type_ref, 
		which is now abstract, so we temporarily wrapped the 
		existing code (for generic_type_ref) in a conditional
		dynamic cast, just to patch and move on... will revisit
		later to complete the chan_type case.  
	  parser/art++-parse.yy: updated symbol return types to reflect
		changes in concrete_type_ref hierarchy.  


2005-05-27	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-06:
	  Added some template methods to context to replace annoying
		copy-pasted methods.  
	  Partially implemented user_chan_type_definition check.  
	  Added a handful of test cases to test/parser/channel.


2005-05-26	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-05:
	  Finished initial crack at type-checking channel definitions, 
		currently, only checking prototype declarations, 
		punting definitions for a few more revisions until
		further testing.  AST files (,h.,tcc) touched: art_parser_base,
		art_parser_definition, art_parser_formal, art_parser_type.
	  Factored out concrete_type_ref::check_build into more useful
		::check_type (useful return value).  
	  Split-off "Object/art_object_definition_chan.h" from 
		"Object/art_object_definition.h", it also uses
		the recently added "Object/art_object_port_formals_manager.h".
		Added a few necessary virtual method overrides 
		to user_def_chan, like those in process_definition.  
		Also cleaned up conditionals, making USE_PORT_FORMALS_MANAGER 
		permanent.  
	  entity::user_def_chan has new field members:
		datatype_list: the datatype (abstract) carried on channel
		port_formals: the physical datatypes used to implement
	  Very basic test cases added so far, more coming in next revision.  
	  Grammar: updated to allow non-built-in datatypes in channel
		definition's abstract data type list.  
	  

2005-05-26	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-04:
	  Revenge of the BSD.  
	  Patches to satisfy gcc-3.4 on FreeBSD, more compiler anality.  
		(Unfortunately, still need to run gmake, not bsdmake.)
	  Changed built-in param type pointers to be part of
		class_traits<Tag> specializations.  
		Global static initialization remains in "art_built_ins.cc".
	  Code cleanup: caught many missing declarations required by gcc-3.4+.
	  src/util/test/Makefile.am link dependencies fixed to work 
		with bsdmake, on the off chance that I forget to run gmake.  


2005-05-25	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-03:
	  Factored out port_formals_manager into own class, 
		now can reuse it for channel_definition, etc.
		That was too easy.  
	  New class files: "Object/art_object_port_formals_manager.{h,cc}"


2005-05-25	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-02:
	  Reorganizing code to make way for channel definition type checking.  
	  Some housecleaning of committed conditional code in
		"AST/art_parser_type_base.h".  
	  TODO next: factor out port_formals_manager from process_definition
		so we may reuse it in used_def_chan.  


2005-05-24	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-01:
	  Starting CHP-01 branch.
	  Liberated parser::CHP classes from the old "check_build".
		Still null implementations at the moment.  
	  Going to fix definition checking, possibly in a sub-branch, 
		before embarking on channel definitions and CHP.  
	  Temporarily made chp_body in grammar optional in several places.  
	  Coming soon: test/parser/channel.  


2005-05-23	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42:
	  Wrote example program of what one might do with production rules
		in an object file, in "prsobjdemo.cc".
	  Updated header checks to use .tccchk suffix for .tcc files.  
	  artobjunroll: check to make sure input file != output (strcmp).  
	  name_space::collect_namepaces works recursively, as it should.  
	  Added collect<> template method to module and namespace, 
		defined in their respective (new) .tcc files.  


2005-05-22	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-41:
	  Header checks: now using .tchk for .tcc files so suffix rules
		don't clash.  
	  Added Object/art_object_util_types.h, which inherited some
		less essential typedefs from Object/art_object_fwd.h.
	  Chased down a few cases of using namespace in headers, 
		and added count_ptr.tcc where necessary.  
	  Few more spots of header fixes.  
	  

2005-05-22	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-40:
	  Lordy, lordy! Snapshot forty!  (This epoch is maturing...)
	  Continued general maintenance:
	  Makefile.am improvements on standalone header validation.  
		Reorganized macro file lists a bit.  
	  generated parser/art++-parse-prefix.h now includes
		(new) "parser/art++-unioin.h" for necessary AST
		class forward declarations to define the YYSTYPE union.  
	  Distribution (distcheck) is still immaculate.  


2005-05-22	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-39:
	  Source organization revision.
	  Instated really anal-retentive "standalone header" tests, 
		affecting headers in all subdirectories.  
	  New Makefile targets:
		check-headers: compiles each {.h,.tcc} file into own executable
			(empty main) to test whether header file depends on
			other headers not already included.  
			Nobody likes a header that only works when other
			(unknown) headers are included.  
		clean-header-tests: basically rm -rf *.hchk
		check: always builds and runs all *.hchk's now.
	  Finally conform to rule: NO "using namespace ...;" in header files, 
		only allowed in source .cc files.  
	  Had to painstakingly explicitly include proper pointer-class
		sources where I was plain lazy before and just included
		"util/memory/pointer_classes.h".  
	  Split up some forward declaration files in util and Object for 
		modularity, minimizing preprocessing in some cases.  
	  Created "util/size_t.h" which includes (conditional on configure)
		<cstddef> for the declaration of size_t.  
	  Making this revision distcheck required some finesse with
		Makefile.am.  


2005-05-20	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-38:
	  Added basic getopt functionality to main programs.  
	  Updated "util/getopt_portable.h" to use configure results.  
	  Factored out main-level functions into main/main_funcs.{h,cc}.
		This nicely hides complexity, making main source 
		tidy and modular.  
	  Separated out util/ library to compile to libfangutil.la.
	  Parser: empty file now returns in non-NULL empty root_body pointer.  
	  util:
		static_trace.h: DEFAULT macros added for simplicity
			(updated uses in AST/*.cc Object/*.cc)
	  some more comments in util/ChangeLog.
	  see also test/ChangeLog for test script updates in this revision.  

	* linux-gcc-3.4 linker not as forgiving about undefined typeinfo of
		unused classes, read: I was lazy.
	  Added skeletal method definitions for currently unused class.


2005-05-19	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-37-merged-PRS-01-09:
	  Merged the -PRS-01 revisions (through -09) to main.  


2005-05-18	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-09:
	  Added a bunch of simple tests for PRS in tests/parser/prs.
	  Fixed some minor bugs *gasp* I discovered on the way.  
	  Added sanity check functions to entity::PRS classes.  
	  Renamed and finished PRS::rule::expand_complement.
	  Adding production rules now auto-expands complements.  
	  prs_expr::dump is prettily-parenthesized.  
	  Updated test/Make.test to include a 'cleaner' target.  


2005-05-17	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-08:
	  Now using ref-counts for all entity::PRS::prs_expr.
	  Finished implementing PRS::prs_expr::negate and 
		negation_normalize (both untested).  
	  Patched count_ptr so self-assignment is checked and handled
		appropriately (could think of it as a bug before, 
		or an unstated limitation).  
	  TODO: generate new test cases for PRS functionality.  
	  TODO: write an example of accessing a process-definition's
		PRS, maybe doing some transformations or diagnostics.  
	  TODO: write some template collection passes for 
		namespace, definitions, etc.
	  IDEA: collate structurally identical bool instance references 
		together into the same reference count pointer, 
		by caching the literals' vars.  


2005-05-17	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-07:
	  This revision doesn't really belong here, but it was done anyhow.
	  What's good for the gander, is good for the goose.
	  Most changes apply to the util library, almost nothing is specific
		to art++ itself.  
	  Updated some uses of util::static_trace -- it really should be
		as early as possible in each translation unit
		for accurate reporting.
	  util::memory::count_ptr now pool allocates reference-counts, 
		making their use extremely efficient.  
		The difficulties lie with a global consistent reference
		to the state of the count-allocator, which itself needs to
		be reference-counted for coherent global static initialization.
		Note: all maanual management of count pointes should use
		the STATIC_RC_POOL_REF_INIT and NEW_SIZE_T macros
		defined in "util/memory/count_ptr.h".
		Also, count_ptr.tcc was split off to facilitate completing
		definitions of other types before their destructor definitions
		are required by the delete operator.  
		Currently, the global reference-count pool is never freed
		until exit -- see remark in 
		"util/memory/ref_count_pool_anchor.h".  
	  Added more useful utility functions to util::memory::chunk_map_pool
		and friends.  
	  Updated some tests in util/test to accommodate library updates.  
		

2005-05-16	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-06:
	  PRS::literal changed to include a count_ptr<bool_instance_reference>
		making it trivially copy-constructible.
	  PRS::pull_{up,dn} includes literal (not pointer thereof) now, 
		resulting in more efficient storage.  
	  PRS::prs_expr and rule's are now chunk_map_pool-allocated.  
	  Some code clean up.  
	  NEXT: negation-normal-form and other utility methods.  
		Possibly reconsider choice of pointers classes
		for expression operands.  


2005-05-16	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-05:
	  Now actually adding production rule objects to process_definition.
	  Implemented PRS dump routines for readable feedback.  
		Currently prints using short local (unqualified) names.  
	  Updated many (object) tests to account for increased size of 
		process_definition binary object
		(+4B for size of PRS pointer list).  
	  This snapshot is a candidate for merging back to main trunk.  


2005-05-15	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-04:
	  Completed expr::check_prs_expr implementations for the 
		relevant expression classes (partially tested).
	  Updated constructor interfaces of entity::PRS classes.  
	  Added blank PRS::rules_list to process_definition, 
		but doesn't do anything with them yet.
		TODO NEXT: implement addition, dump, object persistence.  
	  Moved some files, added some files:
		Split off Object/art_object_PRS_base.h and
			Object/art_object_definition_proc.h.
		Added util/iterator_more.h.
	  One basic test updated parser/basic/013.stderr, was unchecked,
		now gives error.  


2005-05-15	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-03:
	  Parser: promoted token_string and token_char to node_position.
	  Filled-in parser::relational_expr::check_expr, and
		parser::logical_expr::check_expr.
	  Upgraded some expression types in classes for stronger typing.  
	  Started setting up check_prs_expr infrastructure in PRS and expr.  


2005-05-14	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-02:
	  Added initial skeleton classes for PRS objects.  
		Fill-in-the-blanks soon.  
	  Some util library stop-tweaks: persistent_object_manager
		now tracks raw_pointer read-visits separately, 
		added collect_pointer_list template method.


2005-05-14	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-36-PRS-01-01:
	  This branch is for early development of PRS management.  
	  The initial revisions do some clean-up with a few parsers'
		check_build routines; they are still functionally ugly.  
		Beginning to make check routines consistent using more
		CHECK_PROTO macros to keep things straight (e.g. type_base).  
	  node_list has a new check_list template method
		that allows one to specify which element's member function
		to invoke recursively.  We intend to eliminate all generic
		calls to check_build accordingly.  


2005-05-13	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-07:
	  All cleaned up, and ready to merge back to main trunk!
	  All obsolete code involving expr::check_build... GONE.  
	  No trace of object_list remains, nor any of the 
		evil associated therewith.  


2005-05-13	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-06:
	  Pretty much done amputating:
	  entity::object_list is practically eliminated, Gott sei dank!
	  parser::context's object stack is gone.  
	  parser::expr::check_build (and friends) has been phased out.  
		(All conditionally commented out HAVE_EXPR_CHECK_BUILD.)
	  No longer instantiating node_list<const expr>.
	  Eliminated unused class parser::connection_argument_list.
	  Updated calls to check_build to use check_expr and check_reference,
		mostly affecting "AST/art_parser_instance.cc".
	  Upgraded parser::connection_statement's lvalue to inst_ref-expr*.  
	  It's all coming together... now just have to clean up
		the mess of comments and obsolete code.  


2005-05-13	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-05:
	  Continued gradual elimination of expr::check_build (and friends).  
	  Removed inst_ref_expr::check_build().
	  Moved alias_list::postorder_check to expr_list, along with a few
		other useful static functions.  
	  New method for actuals_base::check_actuals, replacing check_build.
	  Added replacement methods for instnace_connection, and 
		connection_statement, calling new check_actuals.  
	  entity::definition has new prototype for certify_port_actuals, 
		process_definition::... has updated definition.  
	  Ported object_list::make_port_connection to 
		connection_statement::make_port_connection (static).
	  parser::actuals_base no longer derived from instance_management.  
	  parser::connection_statement now derived from instance_management.  
	  Partially cleaned up some obsolete code, but there'll be more
		deletions in the next revisions, I promise.  


2005-05-12	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-04:
	  Added expr::check_generic (virtual) to present the result of
	  check_expr or check_reference dynmiacally cast to the other type, 
	  solely for the purposes of working with alias_list's checking
	  procedure.  (read: kludge, but less than it was before)
	  id_expr and member_expr primary check method is now check_reference.  
	  Added placeholder check_generic routines to array_concatenation, 
	  loop_concatenation, and array_construction.  
	  (Will need to add check_reference routines once we start 
	  implementing them.)
	  Updated alias_list::check_build to use check_generic, 
		and moved object_list make_param_expr_assignment
		and make_alias_connection methods into private methods.  
	  Updated token_identifier to use check_reference.  


2005-05-12	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-03:
	  Checked implementation of check_expr, check_reference, 
		check_indices, check_ranges and fixed minor bug 
		since last revision.  
	  Replaced calls to [dense_]range_list::check_build()
		with check_ranges and check_indices where appropriate:
		formal_id's, instance_array.  
	  One problem: check_expr returns param_expr, whereas
		check_reference returns instance_reference_base, 
		both of which are 'objects'.  alias_list is a list of
		expr, but wants generic objects to determine at type-check
		time whether it is forming an expression assignment
		or alias connection sequential instance management item.  
		Thus, we cannot eliminate the object stack (nor calls to
		expr::check_build) until this is resolved.  


2005-05-11	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-02:
	  Implemented expr::check_expr (pure virt.) by mostly trivially
		copying over the old check_build's.  
		Intend to phase out expr-related check_build calls in
		favor of check_expr.  
		check_index, check_ranges, etc. are analogous.  
	  Minor: split off range and range expr into own AST source file.  
	  Minor: permanently erased paren_expr class.  
	  Minor: inst_ref_expr class to sub-type expressions that
		represent instance or value references, adds a virtual
		function check_reference, which will leverage the work
		done by check_expr (or vice versa).  
	  Minor: removed class postfix_expr (was useless).
	  Minor: continued to strip out useless tokens in the AST, 
		also cleaning grammar.  


2005-05-10	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35-exprcheck-01:
	  This branch is intended to rework the way expression checking
	  is done by the parser, replacing the archaic check_build
	  in an orderly manner with object-specific interfaces and routines.
	  In particular, this branch deals with expression checking.  
	  The main goal is to delete the old context::object_stack mechanism
	  used to construct hierarchical expression objects.  
	  This first revision deleted the useless parser::postfix_expr class.  
	  As a result, parser::index_expr is directly derived
	  from parser::expr.
	  After this branch is complete, we can work on fixing
	  type-references (w.r.t. strict and relaxed templates) in
	  a cleaner fashion.  


2005-05-09	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-35 (main trunk):
	  Major organization for sake of code maintainability:
	  Eliminate CPPFLAGS -Iblah.  Include files relative to 
	  root path of source tree, i.e. with Object/ or util/ or AST/...
	  Motivation: reduces code obfuscation, by letting the casual
	  reader know where to find dependent files, rather than counting
	  on knowing which subdirectory each included file belongs in.  
	  Also cleaned up some obsolete code in util/ directory, 
		reducing almost 2000 LOC.  


2005-05-09	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-34 (main trunk):
	  Cleaned up old hash_string code (useless).  
	  Improved some expr/inst_ref dump code to be more verbose, 
		qualifying names of value-references.  


2005-05-08	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-33 (main trunk):
	  Cleaned up conditional code
	  (should've been committed in -template-01 branch).
	  Also removed some dusty obsolete code snippets.  


2005-05-04	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-30 (main trunk):
	  Updated parser/try_lex_catch.awk to also work with yacc output.  

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-28-merged-template-01-09 (main trunk):
	  Merged -template-01 revisions back to trunk.  

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-09:
	  Clean up of previous release: expurgated ART::parser::node!


2005-05-03	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-08:
	  It is done.  ART::parser::node (and all its evils) have been phased
	  out, in favor of a cleaner token class heirarchy.  
	  Not a single test broke!
	  This revision has commented out the evil, next revision will
	  clean up.  


2005-05-03	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-07:
	  Auto-generated parser helper code (union) no longer needs to 
	  return a mother pointer (node*).  
	  It 'virtually' implements the two neceessary functions in two
	  giganormous function pointer tables (delete, what_where).  
	  (A virtual virtual call!)
	  Soon, going to remove ART::parser::node!


2005-05-03	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-06:
	  Parser awk scripts: factored out common subroutines into
	  separate scripts, so now need to invoke awk -f with co-dependent
	  scripts.  This reduces duplicate maintenance on these files, 
	  which will soon be modified, at the cost of having to keep around

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-05:
	  Updated grammar to include instance type completion, 
	  where array instances may have their types completed
	  with relaxed template arguments (after array is declared with 
	  strict template arguments).  
	  (Includes type_completion + connection statement.)
	  check_build for these new classes is yet unimplemented.
	  GRAMMAR UPDATE: removed semicolon after namespace close-brace.
	  Not keeping around silly semicolons in AST structures, 
		deleting useless tokens immediately in parser.  
	  Tests updated accordingly.
	  TODO: re-update all tests with YACC=/usr/bin/yacc configuration.  
		(been forgetting to do this for a long time...)

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-04:
	  Updated ART::parser::node_list::what() message (and test cases).
	  Created class ART::parser::template_argument_list_pair, but unused.
	  Added util/type_traits.h for convenience and compatibility.  
	  Some more parser implementation notes in src/parser/NOTES.  
	  Standardized header inclusion in parser/{yacc,bison}-union-hack.awk.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-03:
	  Parser context now adds template formals to either the 
	  strict parameter list or the relaxed parameter list.  
	  Some minor re-organization to reuse code in template_formals_manager.
	  TODO: Type-references template arguments need to be split into
	  strict and relaxed.  


2005-04-30	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-02:
	  Substituted old template_formals_list and _map in definition_base
	  with a template_formals_manager (basically wrapper around the former)
	  and split up single formal parameter list into a 
	  strict list and relaxed list.  
	  Many definition_base method calls now just wrap around calls
	  to template_formals_manager methods.  
	  As a consequence, the binary format of all definitions
	  has been extended by one pointer-list.  
	  Since none of the current test-cases use relaxed parameters, 
	  the object sizes (per definition) were increased by 4 bytes, 
	  the sizeof(size_t) for '0' representing an empty list.  

		+ Some type-check error messages have been improved.  


2005-04-28	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-01:
	  Updated parser to extend template formal signature to 
	  include (optional) list of relaxed parameters.  
	  In transient state: currently type-checking treats
	  both formal lists as one unified list, even though it is now
	  implemented as a pair of lists in the AST.  
	  The definition structure has not been updated yet.  


2005-04-18	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ART::entity::scopespace is no longer : virtual public object, 
		and ART::entity::namespace is : public object.
		(rationale: simplified class heirarchy somewhat.)

	* ART::entity::definition_base no longer inherits from
		public object virtually.  

	* Started this ChangeLog for more details.
