"ChangeLog"

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-07:
	  Auto-generated parser helper code (union) no longer needs to 
	  return a mother pointer (node*).  
	  It 'virtually' implements the two neceessary functions in two
	  giganormous function pointer tables (delete, what_where).  
	  (A virtual virtual call!)
	  Soon, going to remove ART::parser::node!

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-06:
	  Parser awk scripts: factored out common subroutines into
	  separate scripts, so now need to invoke awk -f with co-dependent
	  scripts.  This reduces duplicate maintenance on these files, 
	  which will soon be modified, at the cost of having to keep around
	  more script files.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-05:
	  Updated grammar to include instance type completion, 
	  where array instances may have their types completed
	  with relaxed template arguments (after array is declared with 
	  strict template arguments).  
	  (Includes type_completion + connection statement.)
	  check_build for these new classes is yet unimplemented.
	  GRAMMAR UPDATE: removed semicolon after namespace close-brace.
	  Not keeping around silly semicolons in AST structures, 
		deleting useless tokens immediately in parser.  
	  Tests updated accordingly.
	  TODO: re-update all tests with YACC=/usr/bin/yacc configuration.  
		(been forgetting to do this for a long time...)

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-04:
	  Updated ART::parser::node_list::what() message (and test cases).
	  Created class ART::parser::template_argument_list_pair, but unused.
	  Added util/type_traits.h for convenience and compatibility.  
	  Some more parser implementation notes in src/parser/NOTES.  
	  Standardized header inclusion in parser/{yacc,bison}-union-hack.awk.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-03:
	  Parser context now adds template formals to either the 
	  strict parameter list or the relaxed parameter list.  
	  Some minor re-organization to reuse code in template_formals_manager.
	  TODO: Type-references template arguments need to be split into
	  strict and relaxed.  


2005-04-30	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-02:
	  Substituted old template_formals_list and _map in definition_base
	  with a template_formals_manager (basically wrapper around the former)
	  and split up single formal parameter list into a 
	  strict list and relaxed list.  
	  Many definition_base method calls now just wrap around calls
	  to template_formals_manager methods.  
	  As a consequence, the binary format of all definitions
	  has been extended by one pointer-list.  
	  Since none of the current test-cases use relaxed parameters, 
	  the object sizes (per definition) were increased by 4 bytes, 
	  the sizeof(size_t) for '0' representing an empty list.  

		+ Some type-check error messages have been improved.  


2005-04-28	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-27-template-01-01:
	  Updated parser to extend template formal signature to 
	  include (optional) list of relaxed parameters.  
	  In transient state: currently type-checking treats
	  both formal lists as one unified list, even though it is now
	  implemented as a pair of lists in the AST.  
	  The definition structure has not been updated yet.  


2005-04-18	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ART::entity::scopespace is no longer : virtual public object, 
		and ART::entity::namespace is : public object.
		(rationale: simplified class heirarchy somewhat.)

	* ART::entity::definition_base no longer inherits from
		public object virtually.  

	* Started this ChangeLog for more details.
