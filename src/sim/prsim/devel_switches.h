/**
	\file "sim/prsim/devel_switches.h"
	prsim preprocessor conditionals.
	Use of this file (ideally) should be confined to the 
	sim/prsim directory.  

	The sole purpose of this file is to provide a convenient
	place to include developer switches.  
	During development, it is often desirable to switch back and forth
	between two implementations and versions, controlled by a single
	preprocessor definition.  
	However, in production code, this file should be EMPTY, 
	and NO translation unit should depend on this i.e. do not include.

	Consequence: more memory per node, due to increased structure size.  
	Status: done and tested, save for new dependent features.
	Goal: 1
	Status: completed, stable, tested for a long time, perm-ready

/**
	Define to 1 to support 'weak' flavored rules in prsim.
	Generally speaking, weak rules are overpowered by non-weak rules, 
	and can also drive rules that are otherwise not driven.  
	Goal: 1
	Rationale: explicit staticizers
	Note: this should not cause any regressions on previous simulations
	that were never aware of the weak attribute.  
	Status: in development

	Fortunately, cause_rule is only used in delay calculations.
