===============================================================================
Simulation:

	Little buglet:
	* when interpreter reports syntax error, position is wrong because
		the construction of each token-position uses the 
		hackt-lexer/AST's global node_position.  
		the instref-lexer is incrementing only it's own private
		position counter.  This can be addressed by using a 
		stack of token positions, once we get to more advanced
		lexer generation manipulation.  Then each lexer/parser
		may use it's own and temporarily save away the previous
		counter.  

prsim:
	category of 'debug' commands for inspecting state, etc...
	direction-specific breakpoints
	deadlock diagnosis, akin to backtrace, but using fanin state analysis
	interpreter commands:
		interp key [value]
			for interpreter mode flags:
			termination conditions: assert, syntax error, 
				bad-argument,...
			echo on, echo off (only heeded in batch mode)
		watch processes and structures?
		'getall-unique' (remove duplicates)
		vector support:
			Q: do we allow nodes to belong to multiple vectors?
				current state of old prsims cannot.
		use getopt-style interpretation?
	concept of environment variables?
	far future: expression evaluation! variable expansion!
		make use of existing interpreter functions in parser/
	Q: should initialize clear the watching state?
		in the old prsim, watch/break points are preserved
		so we keep that behavior for now.  
	for cleanliness:
		rewrite event queuing system to go through
			a pending map first before entering queue.
		rationale: current algorithm is a mess of cases.
	checking: mode to verify that all rules are CMOS implementable
	minor bug: fanout prints duplicate rules because literal
		may appear in different branches of same rule.  
		fix: collect unique-list (or set), then print
