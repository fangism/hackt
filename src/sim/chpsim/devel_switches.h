	Define to 1 to always evaluate read-dependencies 
	and anti-dependencies upon graph construction.  
	Anti-dependencies are only ever needed for dot graph construction, 
	but never for simulation execution.  
	Pretty much only data reading/writing events need these, 
		send, receive, assign.  
	Consequence: memory bloat of events.  
		can be alleviated by pointer-indirection.  
	Goal: 1
	Priority: low-medium
	Pre-requisites: wait until ReadDependenceCollector, 
		and WriteDependenceCollector are written.
		Then may be the same, but certainly not the same
		as BlockDependenceCollector (should rename).
