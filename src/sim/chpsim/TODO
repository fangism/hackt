===============================================================================
chpsim:

high-priority:
	execution trace recording for offline data-mining (thesis work)
		[STATUS: trace recording complete]
	primitive trace querying functions
	guile/scheme wrapper interface to trace primitives
	data structures for results of queries
		guile-scm interface using 'smobs' small-objects

medium-priority:
	trace replay mechanism, seeking to specific state/time.
	non-atomic expression evaluation: [IMPORTANT] 
		rvalue and lvalues of assignments, channel send/receive 
		may contain arbitrary nonmeta-expressions.
		Q: when/how should they be expanded, at source/tree level,
			in intermediate representation, or event-generation?
			Q: should we do version tracking?
		Q: when should evaluation of expressions *begin*?
			do we require flow analysis?
		A: safe to start right when channel event is ready, 
			i.e. predecessors done, and channel state is ready
	support: value probes, missing from CHP language!
		in-source assertions
		these will be implemented as CHP statement attributes,
			BUT we may have two flavors of attributes:
			compile-time (same as construction time)
			and run-time (upon event execution).  
	timing: interface to edit event delays, load back-annotation file?
		possibly more elaborate code to customize delays systematically
	checkpointing: [STATUS: basics done]
		need to remember invocation options in state, 
		and compare when loading checkpoint for consistency.  
	'nobreakall' or 'breaks-off' and 'breaks-on'
	'nowatchall' is done, maybe alias to 'watches-on' and 'watches-off'
		purpose: to be able to quickly turn off and restore
			previous watch/breakpoint configuration, 
			same as prsim

low-priority:
	expr_dump_context: enhance with optional prefix string for
		the enclosing process, useful for printing events with
		more reasonable process names (instead of just pid number)
	stability checking mode:
		(Does something change between time of enqueue to 
			time of execution?)
		for guard expressions
		variables referenced (and their values)
	minor enhancement:
		coalesce common subtrees of forks and joins [low priority]
	visualization: 
		print process-subgraphs as clusters
		print allocated instances and dependency edges to them
			prereq: static data-dependencies and anti-dependencies
	footprint-ize: processes' CHP event subgraphs, easier because
		they are not shared.  
	enhancement: Maybe flag references that are meta to avoid re-checking
		as nonmeta references at run-time.  
		Possibly cache-it as a redundant pointer in CHP expressions.
		Better yet, cache the resolved index as a
			global_indexed_reference.  
	channels: add support for sized types, e.g. bool[4]
	int<W>: using integer width to mask values
		and perform range-checking?
	integer value formatting preference for dumping?
