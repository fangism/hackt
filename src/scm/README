This directory contains scheme modules used by hackt.  
We keep the source directory structure the same as the install
directory hierarchy because the first part of the module name must
be consistent with the location.  In our case, the base directory is 'hackt'.  
This way we don't need any additional magic to test the built package
before vs. after installation.  

Not sure whether this is the best home for scheme modules.
This could also fit lib/scm/hackt.  
We'll how how this works out over time; migration is always an option.
