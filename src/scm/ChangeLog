"scm/ChangeLog"

2007-04-19	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-36:
	  hackt/chpsim.scm: added fork-join pair maps, and a do-while set.  
	  Bunch more nested-loop/do-while test cases added.
	  Added re-usable scripts to test/chpsim:
		event-classification.hacchpsimscm (static)
		basic-trace-analysis.hacchpsimscm (dynamic, trace)


2007-04-17	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-35:
	  hackt/chpsim-trace.scm: make-loop-histogram done, basically tested, 
		unforunately requires branch-count histogram in the event
		that loops begin with branch-selections  :/
	  hackt/chpsim.scm: added loop?/branch? head/tail? predicates
		based on statically-computed sets.
	  Another handful of test cases.


2007-04-16	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-34:
	  hackt/chpsim.scm: autolaod (ice-9 q) for queue/stack structures
		static-event-successors-map-delayed is now defined
			as a delayed map (red-black-tree) of [index,succ-list]
			Dependent algorithms and analyses updated accordingly.
		defined handy DFS traversals of static event graph, used for
			computing memoized subsets of static events:
			static-loop-bound-events-delayed -- bi-maps
				between loop-head and tail (1:1)
			static-branch-bound-events-delayed -- bi-maps
				between branch head and tails (1:1)
		All new subset maps are delayed objects, and thus
			automatically computed on demand and memoized.
		Added some basic test cases, but could really use more...


2007-04-15	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-33:
	  hackt/chpsim.scm: added new constant variables (oxymoron?)
		chpsim-num-events (hac:chpsim-num-events)
		chpsim-static-event-index-stream (0 to N-1)
		New delayed/memoized computed static vent sets:
			static-event-successors-map-delayed
			static-event-predecessors-map-delayed
			static-events-with-multiple-entries-delayed
		Dependencies are automatically satisfied through
			delay-force evaluation.  
		Added some new test cases for these.  
	  hackt/rb-tree.scm: rb-tree->stream (of pairs)
		other source comments added.


2007-04-14	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-32:
	  hackt/chpsim.scm: use named car/cdr for clarity
	  hackt/chpsim-trace.scm: Likewise
	  hackt/rb-tree.scm: more lookup functions, copy-subtree, 
		tree traversals, merge and intersect.  


2007-04-13	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-31:
	  Re-wrote chpsim histogram analyses to use rb-trees, replacing
		linear-search associative lists.
	  Test cases updated with only formatting differences.  
	  FYI: we favor rb-trees because of linear time set operations
		on sorted sets.
	  TODO: rb-tree merge operations, set-intersection/union/difference...


2007-04-12	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-30:
	  hackt/rb-tree.scm: re-wrote repetitive procedures using higher
		levels of abstraction for clarity and brevity.
		And because I feel like flexing scheme skillz...


	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-29:
	  Added hackt/rb-tree.scm, implementation of red-black tree
		borrowed from MIT-scheme library, and adapted to guile.
	  Also added a few test cases to test/guile.  
	  TODO: use rb-tree in place of assoc-lists in analysis library.


2007-04-10	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-28:
	  hackt/algorithm.scm: implemented list-flatten, list-flatten-reverse.
		re-defined filter-split in terms of srfi-1::partition.
		list-contains is removed, just use srfi-1::any.
		implemented find-assoc-ref, using srfi-1::find (on car of elem).
	  hackt/chpsim-trace.scm: use srfi-1::any, 
		and hackt::algorithm::find-assoc-ref.
		NEW: completed branch-selection histogram accumulation:
			'make-select-branch-histogram'
	  hackt/chpsim.scm: autoload stream modules now
		implemented: chpsim-assoc-event-successors, 
			chpsim-assoc-event-pred-from-succ, 
			chpsim-successor-lists->histogram
	  hackt/streams.scm: added
		nth-stream (a.k.a. stream-ref)
		stream-of-lists->stream


2007-04-08	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-27:
	  hackt/chpsim-trace.scm: added critical path functions
		chpsim-trace-critical-path[-from] to report
		precise critical path.  Single test added to test suite.
	  hackt/hackt.scm -> hackt/chpsim.scm: moved type-tag->offset
		because the mapping only pertains to chpsim-related tools.
		Rewrote some dispatchers using type-tag->offset for consistency.


2007-04-07	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-26:
	  hackt/algorithm.scm: added list-contains? predicate
	  hackt/hackt.scm: added type-tag->offset for consistency
	  hackt/chpsim-trace.scm: added tons of stuff:
		chpsim-state-trace-entry-subset (based on type-tag)
		chpsim-state-trace-filter-reference to zoom in on
			events that affect a particular reference.
		chpsim-state-strace-focus-reference to prune-away 
			state changes not referenced.
	  Added test cases to test suite for new functions.  
	  Analyses are just over the horizon.  


2007-04-04	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-23:

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-17:
	  Added documentation strings to nearly all functions, which can
		be read interactively using 'help-hackt' which is just
		an alias for 'procedure-documentation'.
	  Added "hackt/docs.scm" and "hackt/doc-lib.scm" which are works
		in progress ripped from LilyPond -- for documentation 
		generation.

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-10:
	  hackt/streams.scm: tested and fixed stream-stop,

	  hackt/streams.scm:
		deifned stream-start and stream-stop which truncate
		streams at the head or tail based on a predicate.

		but do not involve trace file reading.

		other handy routines for working with hackt.  
	  Added TODO, Makefile.am, README.

		from ice-9/streams.  
	  TODO: handle GUILE_LOAD_PATH during testing and post-install.
