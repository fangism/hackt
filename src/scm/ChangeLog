"scm/ChangeLog"

2007-04-13	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-31:
	  Re-wrote chpsim histogram analyses to use rb-trees, replacing
		linear-search associative lists.
	  Test cases updated with only formatting differences.  
	  FYI: we favor rb-trees because of linear time set operations
		on sorted sets.
	  TODO: rb-tree merge operations, set-intersection/union/difference...

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-30:
	  hackt/rb-tree.scm: re-wrote repetitive procedures using higher
		levels of abstraction for clarity and brevity.
		And because I feel like flexing scheme skillz...


	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-29:
	  Added hackt/rb-tree.scm, implementation of red-black tree
		borrowed from MIT-scheme library, and adapted to guile.
	  Also added a few test cases to test/guile.  
	  TODO: use rb-tree in place of assoc-lists in analysis library.


2007-04-10	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-28:
	  hackt/algorithm.scm: implemented list-flatten, list-flatten-reverse.
		re-defined filter-split in terms of srfi-1::partition.
		list-contains is removed, just use srfi-1::any.
		implemented find-assoc-ref, using srfi-1::find (on car of elem).
	  hackt/chpsim-trace.scm: use srfi-1::any, 
		and hackt::algorithm::find-assoc-ref.
		NEW: completed branch-selection histogram accumulation:
			'make-select-branch-histogram'
	  hackt/chpsim.scm: autoload stream modules now
		implemented: chpsim-assoc-event-successors, 
			chpsim-assoc-event-pred-from-succ, 
			chpsim-successor-lists->histogram
	  hackt/streams.scm: added
		nth-stream (a.k.a. stream-ref)
		stream-of-lists->stream


2007-04-08	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-27:
	  hackt/chpsim-trace.scm: added critical path functions
		chpsim-trace-critical-path[-from] to report
		precise critical path.  Single test added to test suite.
	  hackt/hackt.scm -> hackt/chpsim.scm: moved type-tag->offset
		because the mapping only pertains to chpsim-related tools.
		Rewrote some dispatchers using type-tag->offset for consistency.


2007-04-07	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-26:
	  hackt/algorithm.scm: added list-contains? predicate
	  hackt/hackt.scm: added type-tag->offset for consistency
	  hackt/chpsim-trace.scm: added tons of stuff:
		chpsim-state-trace-entry-subset (based on type-tag)
		chpsim-state-trace-filter-reference to zoom in on
			events that affect a particular reference.
		chpsim-state-strace-focus-reference to prune-away 
			state changes not referenced.
	  Added test cases to test suite for new functions.  
	  Analyses are just over the horizon.

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-23:

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-21:

2007-03-27	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-17:
	  Added documentation strings to nearly all functions, which can
		be read interactively using 'help-hackt' which is just
		an alias for 'procedure-documentation'.
	  Added "hackt/docs.scm" and "hackt/doc-lib.scm" which are works
		in progress ripped from LilyPond -- for documentation 
		generation.  


2007-03-25	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-13:
	  hackt/chpsim.scm: chpsim-event-may-block-deps to add type-tags
		to the list-of-list structure returned by the primitive
		chpsim-event-may-block-deps-internal.


2007-03-24	David Fang	<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-15-scm-01-10:
	  hackt/streams.scm: tested and fixed stream-stop,

	  Ooops, forgot about this ChangeLog.
	  hackt/streams.scm:
		deifned stream-start and stream-stop which truncate
		streams at the head or tail based on a predicate.
	  Added hackt/chpsim.scm: for functions that pertain to chpsim, 
		but do not involve trace file reading.

		other handy routines for working with hackt.  
	  Added TODO, Makefile.am, README.
	  Added hackt/streams.scm, which includes some functions missing
		from ice-9/streams.  
	  TODO: handle GUILE_LOAD_PATH during testing and post-install.
