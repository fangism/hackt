"scm/TODO"

Populate this directory with Scheme modules for working with HACKT.

Top priority: hackt's chpsim trace interface for analysis (under way)

global-reference pairs: replace first element (type enum) with some
	quoted tag, like 'bool, etc...
	rationale: for comprehensibility

accessor functions to event-node-ptr SMOB
	type info
	successors and predecessors
	block dependencies

other stream interfaces:
	all-static-events (easily built in pure scheme, already in test case)
	stream of modified state (by event-index) per type of variable, 
		which can then be unified
	stream of read (accessed) state/variables? may be difficult

event-filtering predicates

reverse-streams: critical path?
slack-time annotation?

scm structures for variable sets

trees and sets in scheme library? (associative structures)

stream merge algorithms (like set_intersection, set_union, set_difference)
