Populate this directory with Scheme modules for working with HACKT.

Top priority: hackt's chpsim trace interface for analysis (under way)

global-reference pairs: replace first element (type enum) with some
	quoted tag, like 'bool, etc...
	rationale: for comprehensibility, currently using define'd constants

accessor functions to event-node-ptr SMOB
	type info [partially done, in the form of predicates, can be refined]
	successors and predecessors
	block dependencies
	may-read/write dependencies

other stream interfaces:
	stream of modified state (by event-index) per type of variable, 
		which can then be unified
	stream of read (accessed) state/variables? may be difficult


reverse-streams: critical path?
slack-time annotation?
	requires reconstructing precise causality graph of all events?
		could be major memory hog...

scm structures for variable sets
	plain list of references (type-index pairs)

trees and sets in scheme library? (associative structures)
	look into guile's alist (associative list?)
	also srfi/srfi-1 alist

stream merge algorithms (like set_intersection, set_union, set_difference)
	prerequisite: streams already sorted
