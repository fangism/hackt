Bugs wanted: dead or alive.

Welcome to Season 2 of HACKT bug-hunting!

Effective 2005-11-03 through 2005-12-31:
In the quest to produce a more perfect kompiler, I, fangism, have posted
this bounty notice for discovered bugs.

Rewards:
One standard unit of reward will be a snack or drink from the CSL fridge, 
whose monetary value is capped at $.50.

Positive feedback:
Reports that everything is working (build, check) are worth one unit.  

Positive bugs: Classification
build-failure: package fails to build on a platform/system that is NOT
	on the list of unsupported platforms/compilers, worth 3 units.
rejects-valid: compiler rejects valid code, worth 1 unit.
accepts-invalid: compiler accepts invalid code, worth 1 units.  
wrong-result: compiler produces incorrect result, worth 2 units. 
ICE: internal compiler errors, includes all assertion failures, worth 3 units.  

Not bugs:
Features that are missing are not considered bugs.  
Missing documentation is not a bug, but should be reported anyhow.  

Known bugs and duplicates:
Duplicates are bugs that have already been reported and flagged as valid.  
Trivial test-case variations that produce the same bug do not count.  
Known bugs and duplicate bug reports count for zero reward units.  
Duplicates to tell me what's important to fix because several individual
independently trip the same problem, so do let me know that you've 
found the same problems.  

Procedure:
Build-failure reports consist of a description of the platform
(architecture-OS-compiler) and a log of the build process, starting
from the configure invocation.  
All other bug-reports require a test-case, an input which exhibits the
alleged bug.  The test-case need not be minimal, but one should make a
reasonable effort to reduce the test case.  The only case when a 
test-case is not required is when the case is already
in the test suite.  Finally the report should consist of a list of steps
taken (commands run) to produce the bug.  

The FIRST valid bug one finds (per season) is worth two additional 
standard units, on top of the bug's worth.  

Bug slayers:
Individuals who FIX bugs shall be rewarded double the value of the 
bug's worth.  

Adjudication:
I, fangism, will be the final judge on the resolution of each bug report.  
Reward substitution is negotiable, but be forewarned that I drive
a hard bargain.  

Bonus:
The individual who has the most bugs (count, not net worth) found to 
his/her credit by the expiration date of this bounty shall receive a 
bonus reward to be announced at a later date, worth up to $20, 
such as a free dinner.
