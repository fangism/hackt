"BOUNTY"

Bugs wanted: dead or alive.

Effective 2005-07-24 through 2005-09-30, 
In the quest to produce a more perfect kompiler, I, fangism, have posted
this bounty notice for discovered bugs.

Rewards:
One standard unit of reward will be a snack or drink from the CSL fridge, 
whose monetary value is capped at $.50.

Positive feedback:
Reports that everything is working (build, check) are worth one unit.  

Positive bugs: Classification
build-failure: package fails to build on a platform/system that is NOT
	on the list of unsupported platforms/compilers, worth 3 units.
rejects-valid: compiler rejects valid code, worth 1 unit.
accepts-invalid: compiler accepts invalid code, worth 1 units.  
wrong-result: compiler produces incorrect result, worth 2 units. 
ICE: internal compiler errors, includes all assertion failures, worth 3 units.  

Not bugs:
Features that are missing are not considered bugs.  
Missing documentation is not a bug, but should be reported anyhow.  

Known bugs and duplicates:
Duplicates are bugs that have already been reported and flagged as valid.  
Trivial test-case variations that produce the same bug do not count.  
Known bugs and duplicate bug reports count for zero reward units.  

Procedure:
Build-failure reports consist of a description of the platform
(architecture-OS-compiler) and a log of the build process, starting
from the configure invocation.  
All other bug-reports require a test-case, an input which exhibits the
alleged bug.  The test-case need not be minimal, but one should make a
reasonable effort to reduce the test case.  The only case when a 
test-case is not required is when the case is already
in the test suite.  Finally the report should consist of a list of steps
taken (commands run) to produce the bug.  

The FIRST valid bug one finds is worth two additional standard units, 
on top of the bug's worth.  

Bug slayers:
Individuals who FIX bugs shall be rewarded double the value of the 
bug's worth.  

Adjudication:
I, fangism, will be the final judge on the resolution of each bug report.  
Reward substitution is negotiable, but be forewarned that I drive
a hard bargain.  

Bonus:
The individual who has the most bugs (count, not net worth) found to 
his/her credit by the expiration date of this bounty shall receive a 
bonus reward to be announced at a later date, worth up to $20, 
such as a free dinner.

Tally:

Chris LaFrieda: 6 units earned for 2 reports
	1 build-failure reported (x3 = 3 units)
	1 getopt compatibility issue (1 unit)
