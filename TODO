this TODO list is way outdated... clean TODO list.
Pay more attention to the src/ChangeLog.  

REVISION TARGETS:

0.1.4 series goals for 0.1.5:
	(all old goals have been completed long ago)

0.1.6 Goals:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
for lack of organization:
list of things accomplished in 0.1.3 series:

	BASIC parameter unrolling only (scalars)
		done for integers, including arrays.

	MAJOR ISSUES with parameter unrolling and assignment ordering
		(resolved: ordered items are decoupled from scopes)
	keep definitions around as back-references in unpacked objects.
	unpack instantiation_bases into live instances
		using multidimensional_qmap, or now, multikey_qmap.  
		Make live instances and multidimensional sets persistent.
		Mark modules as unrolled or not.  

	Hold off on parameter assignments until after restructuring
		parameter_assignment classes.  
		(*done* -- 10/09/04)

	Add cvs Id tags to all source files (done -- 11/01/04).  
		Maybe non-essential files as well...
	
	Documentation: add documentation headers to beginning of
		every source file, so doxygen will create file
		inclusion dependence graphs! (*done* -- 10/09/04)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGING

	Write an installed script (init.csh) that sets environment variables
and paths automatically, adjusting library paths, MAN_PATH, etc...
One should be able to switch between installations in different locations
by sourcing these scripts.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source management:
	automake: AUTO_IGNORE_PATTERNS for cvsignore
