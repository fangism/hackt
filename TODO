this TODO list is way outdated... clean TODO list.
Pay more attention to the src/ChangeLog.  

REVISION TARGETS:

0.1.4 series goals for 0.1.5:
	(all old goals have been completed long ago)

0.1.6 Goals:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
for lack of organization:
list of things accomplished in 0.1.3 series:

	BASIC parameter unrolling only (scalars)
		done for integers, including arrays.

	MAJOR ISSUES with parameter unrolling and assignment ordering
		(resolved: ordered items are decoupled from scopes)
	keep definitions around as back-references in unpacked objects.
	unpack instantiation_bases into live instances
		using multidimensional_qmap, or now, multikey_qmap.  
		Make live instances and multidimensional sets persistent.
		Mark modules as unrolled or not.  

	Hold off on parameter assignments until after restructuring
		parameter_assignment classes.  
		(*done* -- 10/09/04)

	Add cvs Id tags to all source files (done -- 11/01/04).  
		Maybe non-essential files as well...
	
	Documentation: add documentation headers to beginning of
		every source file, so doxygen will create file
		inclusion dependence graphs! (*done* -- 10/09/04)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGING

	Write an installed script (init.csh) that sets environment variables
and paths automatically, adjusting library paths, MAN_PATH, etc...
One should be able to switch between installations in different locations
by sourcing these scripts.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source management:
	automake: AUTO_IGNORE_PATTERNS for cvsignore

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
configury:
	organize configure checks by section:
		basic build environment
		programs and paths
		compiler and required compilation tools
			headers, standard libraries
			options, flags, characteristics, conformance...
		architecture-depedendence
		library functions
		headers
		packages...
	summarize results of configure at the very end
	stating which required packages missing
		which optional packages found, etc...
	save errors until the very end for summary
	produce a pkg-config .pc file if available, using configure results
