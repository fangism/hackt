You've just checked out HACKT from CVS, what do you need to need to work?

	"It's not so hard to lift yourself by your bootstraps 
	once you're off the ground."
					-- Daniel B. Luten

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting started:

If you've checked out this project from CVS as opposed to a distribution
tarball (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2), then you'll need the following GNU autotools
installed on your system:

GNUmake-3.79+ is recommended
automake-1.9+ (OK: 1.10)
autoconf-2.59+ (OK: 2.60)
libtool-1.5+

These may be obtained from gnu.org.  
TODO: provide a download script for the truly lazy...
The first thing to do is run:

./bootstrap

which runs the GNU autotool commands to create a configure script
(from configure.ac) and configurable Makefile.in's (from Makefile.am's).
This does a little bit more than the standard "autoreconf -i", 
which is conventionally used to regenerate the same set of files.  
With a tarball distribution, you won't need to run bootstrap unless
you modify the Makefile.am's or configure.ac.  
Even when the auto* sources are modified, the Makefiles are built with 
maintainer-mode off, so the autotools will automatically regenerate files 
as necessary.  (You shouldn't have to run bootstrap more than once 
per checkout.) To clobber the files generated by the bootstrap process, run:

scripts/maintainerclobber

which is the equivalent of a cvs-clean.

Other tools needed:

swig-1.3.20+ (wrapped interface generator)
	This generates guile-scm wrappers from C/C++ headers.

For more on the CVS tags and make conventions, mostly for maintainers, 
refer to "README.maintainer".

Updating from CVS:

Occasionally, header files are removed from CVS as they become replaced
or deprecated.  You see a message like:

	file-xyz.h is no longer in the repository

Unfortunately, this can occasionally leave stale dependencies (in src/)
that are used for header-validation, a feature I've added to the build
machinery for this project.  If you see an error message like the following:

	cc1plus: blah.h: No such file or directory
	make[1]: *** [blah.hchk] Error 1

This means that the source header was removed.  The recommend course of 
action is the following:

	cd src; make clean-header-deps clean-header-tests

and then return to 'make' or whatever you were doing.  
This resets all the dependencies and cleans the validation results, which
will be automatically regenerated upon make.  
This will never be a problem for those who use source distribution tarballs.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch creation relative to CVS:

For those contributing patches, the easiest way to create a patch is to run:
'make cvsdiffs' from anywhere in the build directory, which can be the same
as the source directory for non-VPATH builds.  (This is a global target in
all Makefiles, so you can run in most subdirectories.)  If you don't have 
commit privileges or prior approval, send the resulting file to the 
developer(s).
