"pkg/README"

This directory contains miscellaneous package descriptions for HACKT.
Until this directory gets a Makefile.am of its own, list these files
in the parent directory's Makefile.am under EXTRA_DIST.  

=============================================================================
Fink: (Mac OS X)

hackt-dist-deps.info: distribution dependencies
hackt-git-deps.info: git checkout build dependencies

To use these, copy the files to /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/
and re-run 'fink index'.  
Then 'fink install hackt-dist-deps' (or the git variant) to install 
the necessary dependent packages.
These are dummy packages that may be removed at any time.  
They use the BuildDepends mechanism to temporarily install the required
packages.
