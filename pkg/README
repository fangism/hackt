"pkg/README"

This directory contains miscellaneous package descriptions for HACKT.
Until this directory gets a Makefile.am of its own, list these files
in the parent directory's Makefile.am under EXTRA_DIST.  

=============================================================================
Fink: (Mac OS X)

hackt-dist-deps.info: distribution dependencies
hackt-cvs-deps.info: CVS build dependencies

To use these, copy the files to /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/
and re-run 'fink index'.  
Then 'fink install hackt-dist-deps' (or the cvs variant) to install 
the necessary dependent packages.
These are dummy packages that may be removed at any time.  
They use the BuildDepends mechanism to temporarily install the required
packages.  

TODO: 
	fink packages for hackt itself.  Those should have true dependencies
		on the necessary shlibs.  
	devel-deps: dependencies recommended for developers

reminder:
ConfigureParams:
	--with-guile-config=guile-1.8-config
	--with-guile-snarf=guile-1.8-snarf
	--with-guile-tools=guile-1.8-tools

DISCLAIMER: these fake packages have not undergone any real validation.
