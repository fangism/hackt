DescDetail: <<
Installing this bundle will install all prerequisites for building HACKT
from a distribution tarball.
.
Bison can be replaced with /usr/bin/yacc, anything BUT Apple's bison-1.28.
Known good versions of flex include 2.5.4, 2.5.31, NOT 2.5.33.
Issue: guile18-dev is BuildDependsOnly, only need guile18-shlibs installed.
The hackt package should BuildDepends guile18-dev.
GraphViz is needed for dot.
tetex-base is needed for documentation builds (latex).
transfig is needed for fig2dev (xfig)
readline5 is optional, but we list it here anyways (4.3 works too).

DescPackaging: <<
Fink bundle package based on version tagged HACKT-00-01-04-main-00-81-41.  
Could make a no-guile version too, I suppose.  
Maintainence: since build-deps are not recursive, keep this synchronized
with the hackt-cvs-deps.
