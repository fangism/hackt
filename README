"README"

Welcome to HACKT, a compiler suite for asynchronous system design!  

I'll write more in the README when I have time.

Getting started:

If you've checked out this project from CVS as opposed to a distribution
tarball (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2), then you'll need the following GNU autotools
installed on your system:

GNUmake-3.79+ is recommended
automake-1.9+
autoconf-2.59+
libtool-1.5+

These may be obtained from gnu.org.  
The first thing to do is run:

./bootstrap

which runs the GNU autotool commands to create a configure script
(from configure.ac) and configurable Makefile.in's (from Makefile.am's).
With a tarball distribution, you won't need to run bootstrap unless
you modify the Makefile.am's or configure.ac.  

The remainder of this section is described in more detail in INSTALL.  
To start the build run "./configure" with your elected options.  
Assuming configure is heppy with the system, you're ready to run "make".  

After the build is finished, I strongly recommend running "make check"
from the root directory to run the test suite on the built executables.

FOR DEVELOPERS

Makefiles:

This section describes the use of Make.stddef and Make.global makefile
fragments.  Make.stddef is a makefile header whose purpose is to 
define project-wide macros for popular command-line utilities, and to 
initialize standard macro variables that are used to accumulate 
over a makefile, e.g. CLEANFILES.  This relieves one of remembering
where the first definition of some common variables are -- if it's
common, it belongs in Make.stddef.  Make.stddef should be the first
thing included by other makefiles, either directly or indirectly.  
Make.global contains common project-wide Makefile targets.  By including
this at the end of each makefile, you automatically inherit a bunch of
useful targets.  Some of the targets depend on variables that accumulate
since their initializations in Make.stddef, such as AUTO_IGNORE.  
Make.global should be the last make-fragment included in any makefile.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS tags:

If you have cvs read access, then you can select specific versions and 
releases of the art++ package.  

The standard tag names are: ARTXX-##-##-## (for pre-HACKT revisions)
	or HACKT-##-##-## for all new revisions, 
	where ## is a 2 digit number (including leading zeros).  
Eventually, branch tags wil be introduced by appending
	-BRANCHNAME-##-## to the tag names.  
	The first -## of the branch name may be optional, 
	it is sometimes useful to reuse the same branch name with
	a different number to signify a new epoch of revisions with
	the same theme.

cvsignore (a phony make target to make .cvsignore recursively)

CVS ignore files (.cvsignore) are all semi-automatically generated
in this project.  The rationale behind this is that automake already
knows most of the files that should be ignored because they are 
built (although there are always exceptions).  The Makefile system
uses AUTO_IGNORE as a cumulative list of files to automatically ignore.  
In addition, the generated .cvsignore files depend on a local.cvsignore
file from which it acquires user-defined (non-automatic) files.  
local.cvsignore is also where wildcard patterns belong.  
The local.cvsignore file may also be automatically generated by other 
means, e.g., copying from an existing .cvsignore.
