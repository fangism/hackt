Welcome to ART++, a compiler suite for asynchronous system design!  

I'll write more in the README when I have time.

CVS tags:

If you have cvs read access, then you can select specific versions and 
releases of the art++ package.  

The standard tag names are: ARTXX-##-##-##
	where ## is a 2 digit number (including leading zeros).  
Eventually, branch tags wil be introduced by appending
	-BRANCHNAME-##-## to the tag names.
