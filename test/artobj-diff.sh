# "artobj-diff.sh"
# compares textual object dumps

# $1 is the executable for generating the object file, (probably art++2obj)
#	and producing a textual dump to stderr.  
# $2 is the executable for reading in the object file, (probably artobjdump)
#	and producing a textual dump to stderr.
# $3 is the path to the source directory, which is not necessarily ./
#	especially during a vpath build for distcheck.
# $4 is the input file name WITHOUT the .in extension
#	prerequisite: the input file must pass type-checking
# $5 is the filter command for ignoring difference in output
#	(for no filter, pass "cat")
# $6 is the test report log file, summarizing results
# additional arguments are ignored.  

# if the .test file exists, then program didn't crash, we can proceed.
