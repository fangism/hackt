KNOWN BUG: this ICEs-on-invalid
source_e1of1<2> == source_e<1><2,d[2]>
... which means we've partially substituted parameters in the 
canonical type's relaxed template parameters.
However, relaxed parameters cannot be partially substituted
(all or none), which then fails to find default values for ::d.
Results in size assertion failure.
