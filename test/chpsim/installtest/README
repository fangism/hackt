# "README"

This directory contains an example of how to link CHPSIM to a dynamically
loaded module with user-defined functions.  
This directory also serves as an install-time check for package checking;
the example can be run after installing with "make installcheck" in the
parent directory $(top_builddir)/test/chpsim.
("make distcheck" actually does this during testing!)

This example is discussed in greater detail in the 
dox/chpsim/hacchpsim.{info,pdf,ps,html} documents generated by Texinfo.  

For convenience we also install this example under
$(docdir)/examples/chpsim-function/, which expands to something like 
$(prefix)/share/hackt/doc/examples/chpsim-function/.

Follow the walk-through instructions described in the documentation
to manually re-run this example locally.
