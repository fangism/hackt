b : bool b = 0
i : int i = 0
event queue:
check queue:
	time	eid	pid	event
	0	0	1	null
launch initial null event 
b : bool b = 0
i : int i = 0
event queue:
check queue:
	time	eid	pid	event
	10	1	0	i := 13
first event 
b : bool b = 0
i : int i = 13
event queue:
check queue:
	time	eid	pid	event
	20	2	0	b := true
second event 
b : bool b = 1
time: 20
now queue should be empty 
event queue:
check queue:
	(empty)
time: 20
