event c+ was converted to X

event c- was silently overturned to c+ 
testing weak instability... 
No event pending on `c'.
WARNING: weak-interference `c'

	30	a : X

should suppress c+ weak unstable 
c should still become X

WARNING: weak-interference `c'

	50	a : X

should suppress c- weak unstable
