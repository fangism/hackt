timing [mode [args]]
if no mode is given, just reports the current mode.
available timing modes:
	random [[min]:[max]]
	binary [min]:[max] prob
	uniform [delay]
	after
Random mode uses a heavy-tailed distribution random-variable for delay, *except* where a delay is marked with [after=0].
Default min and max delay bounds can be set with an additional MIN:MAX
argument.  A blank value will clear the bound to 0.
A max value of 0 is interpreted as being unbounded.
Uniform mode ignores all after-delay annotations and uses a fixed delay for all events, which can be used to count transitions.
After mode uses fixed after-annotated delays for timing, and assumes
default delays where none are given.
Binary mode chooses between the min and max values only with the given
probability p of choosing min, and also ignores all specified rule delays,
including after=0 delays.
Use 'seed48' to set a random number seed.
