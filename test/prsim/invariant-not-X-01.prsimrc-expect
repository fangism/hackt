This test reveals a fundamental bug in the way expressions 
are evaluated and firings are propagated. 
Below we false positive reports of invariant violations 
due to evaluation ordering. 
[top-level]
invariants:
$(a | ~a)
$(~b | b)
$(c | ~c | c | ~c)
$(~d | d | ~d | d)
abcd: X -> 0 
abcd: 0 -> 1 
Warning: invariant violation in [top-level]: (~b:1 | b:1<0>) by node b:1
abcd: 1 -> X 
Warning: possible invariant violation in [top-level]: (a:X | ~a:X<X>) by node a:X
