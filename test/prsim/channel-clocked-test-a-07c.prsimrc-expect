There's no such thing as a sync-sink! 
Warning: Ignoring.  What exactly do you expect a sync. sink to do?
usage: channel-expect-fail [ignore|warn|notify|break|interactive|fatal]
Set error-handling policy on channel-expect failures.
	ignore: silently ignores violation
	warn: print warning without halting
	notify: (same as warn)
	break: notify and halt
	interactive: halt and start an interactive sub-shell (exit resumes)
	fatal: immediately terminate simulator with nonzero exit status
current mode: fatal
