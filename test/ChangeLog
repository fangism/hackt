2005-08-04	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-52-configtest-02:

		results of configure.  


2005-07-24	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-51:
	  Updated Make.test-tail to use new double-command form
		of executable "hackt <command>".


2005-07-22	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-49-maintainence-01:
	  Reworked Makefile.am structure, replacing Make.test
		with Make.test-head (include first) and Make.test-tail
		(include last).

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-23:
	  Made `cleaner' recursive in Make.test, inherited by other
		Makefiles in subdirectories.  
	  Changed artobjunroll test script!
		We now store the *filtered* unrolldump in the the
		repository's .stderr outputs, since there's no sense in
		keeping the unfiltered version around for comparison.  
		This will also dramatically reduce the size of the
		patches everytime the binaries change size as a result
		of individual objects changing size.

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-19:
	  Enhanced Make.test to include a check.log target, which
		saves the results of "make -k check" to log file, 
		and dumps a quick failure summary.  This is usable
		in the top test directory, and any of its subdirectories, 
		thanks to automake.  Should've done this ages ago.  


2005-06-18	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-22:
	  "state_enum_filter.awk" handle case of bison grammar output
		where a the LHS of a rule is abbreviated with just '|'
		as a continuation of the previous line.  
		(bison vs. yacc difference)


2005-05-20	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-38:
	  Added this ChangeLog.
	  Added POM-header-filter.awk to reduces test expectation conflicts
		due to trivial (insignificant) differences 
		and path-related differences.
	  artobj-diff.sh: added -d flag to art++2obj invocation
		to cause textual dump.  
	  	set up $filter command as pure pipe.
	  artobjunroll-expect.sh: set up $filter command as pure pipe.
