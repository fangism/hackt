	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-19:
	  Enhanced Make.test to include a check.log target, which
		saves the results of "make -k check" to log file, 
		and dumps a quick failure summary.  This is usable
		in the top test directory, and any of its subdirectories, 
		thanks to automake.  Should've done this ages ago.

	  "state_enum_filter.awk" handle case of bison grammar output
		where a the LHS of a rule is abbreviated with just '|'
		as a continuation of the previous line.  
		(bison vs. yacc difference)
