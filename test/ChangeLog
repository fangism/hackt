# "test/ChangeLog"

2005-11-01	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-62-cflat-02-04:
	  Enhanced hackt-cflat-test.sh.in to check and see if 
		.prs differences are only a result of reordering.  


2005-10-27	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-61-flow-01-04:
	  Finally figured out how to redirect stderr+stdout without going 
		through cat.  Just append file descriptor combiner at the end.
		e.g. foo > log 2>&1.
		Now test scripts don't have to execute same program twice
		to get exit status and log files separately.  
		I love Bourne shell (/bin/sh).  
	  Updated *.sh.in test scripts accordingly.  


2005-10-25	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-60-merged-PRS-02-11:
	  Merge to trunk.  Includes some minor test template revisions.  


2005-09-14	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-59-merged-unique-02-15:
	  Branch merge.  


2005-09-12	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-58-unique-02-07:
	  Added test support for unique state allocation (alloc) phase.  
	  Expected output format is only tentative, until a complete
		implementation of objdump for state comes along (soon).  


2005-09-04	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-56-merged-footprint-01-36:
	  Merged revisions and enhancements from -footprint branch.
	  Most notably the diff analysis scripts.  


2005-08-25	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-55-footprint-01-24:
	  Unroll and create test scripts now check for input file existence
		and non-zero size before executing.  


2005-08-15	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-55-footprint-01-06-merged-canonical-07:
	  Merged test suite revisions from branch.  
		Include test-analysis extensions.  
	  Many tests themselves were updated because of new object binary.


2005-08-14	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-55-footprint-01-05-canonical-03:
	  This revision arrives after having spent considerable effort 
		reworking the canonical type management in HACKT.
		The information in the objects remains the same while 
		the object binaries changed somewhat.  The new scripts
		introduced aid in the analysis of these "insignficant"
		differences.  
	  New: POM-index-filter.awk: takes the output of POM-header-filter.awk
		and filters out the indices of the object manager header. 
		Useful for minimizing the differences between object binaries.  
	  Extended unroll and create test script templates to
		conditionally perform further analysis on object dump
		differences, depending on whether or not non-header
		differences (in the human readable section) were introduced.  
	  analyze-dump-diff.awk: assess the nature of the object
		dump's differences.  Takes a diff -u output as input.  
	  Make.test-tail: updated to reflect script and test additions.  
		Notable: added check-summaries target.


2005-08-06	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-53-unique-01-06:
	  Added automake macros and rules for hackt create tests.  
		using .hacktcreatetest as generated test script, 
		.hacktobjcreate as created object file, 
		.create{dump,stderr,diff} as test outputs.  
	  Added hackt-create-expect.sh.in configured test script.  
	  Moved standard TESTS definition (+=) to Make.test-tail.
	  TODO: eventually abandon the ART/art names and adopt HACKT/hackt.  


2005-08-04	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-53-merged-configtest-03:
	  Merged revisions from -configtest (-03) branch.


2005-08-04	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-52-configtest-02:
	  Made test shell scripts configure-generated, using the 
		results of configure.  


2005-07-24	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-51:
	  Updated Make.test-tail to use new double-command form
		of executable "hackt <command>".


2005-07-22	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-49-maintainence-01:
	  Reworked Makefile.am structure, replacing Make.test
		with Make.test-head (include first) and Make.test-tail
		(include last).


2005-07-08	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-23:
	  Made `cleaner' recursive in Make.test, inherited by other
		Makefiles in subdirectories.  
	  Changed artobjunroll test script!
		We now store the *filtered* unrolldump in the the
		repository's .stderr outputs, since there's no sense in
		keeping the unfiltered version around for comparison.  
		This will also dramatically reduce the size of the
		patches everytime the binaries change size as a result
		of individual objects changing size.  


2005-07-07	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-48-connect-01-19:
	  Enhanced Make.test to include a check.log target, which
		saves the results of "make -k check" to log file, 
		and dumps a quick failure summary.  This is usable
		in the top test directory, and any of its subdirectories, 
		thanks to automake.  Should've done this ages ago.  


2005-06-18	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-42-CHP-01-22:
	  "state_enum_filter.awk" handle case of bison grammar output
		where a the LHS of a rule is abbreviated with just '|'
		as a continuation of the previous line.  
		(bison vs. yacc difference)


2005-05-20	David Fang		<fangism@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ARTXX-00-01-04-main-00-38:
	  Added this ChangeLog.
	  Added POM-header-filter.awk to reduces test expectation conflicts
		due to trivial (insignificant) differences 
		and path-related differences.
	  artobj-diff.sh: added -d flag to art++2obj invocation
		to cause textual dump.  
	  	set up $filter command as pure pipe.
	  artobjunroll-expect.sh: set up $filter command as pure pipe.
