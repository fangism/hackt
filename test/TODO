re-organize Make.test-* contents so variables and targets associated
	with each test are grouped together

Detected whether or not we are VPATH building, for the cases
	where we copy or link tests (.stderr) from srcdir to builddir, 
	we'd prefer to distinguish when we'd need to clean certain files.
	e.g. if !VPATH, don't remove the stderr files, else remove them
	upon cleaning!  see why in artc-expect.sh.in.
