rewrite tests so they can be "run" in parallel
	use check_TESTS, check_TESTS as a target and use dependency rules
	to run the tests as targets, and have the scripts
	just echo/return the result of the test.
	This also requires heavy automatic dependency generation
	for all tests.  

Detected whether or not we are VPATH building, for the cases
	where we copy or link tests (.stderr) from srcdir to builddir, 
	we'd prefer to distinguish when we'd need to clean certain files.
	e.g. if !VPATH, don't remove the stderr files, else remove them
	upon cleaning!  see why in artc-expect.sh.in.

Detect presence of certain old cast-based tools? like prsim?
	Would be nice to conditionally run them as regression tests.  
	To be done with autoconf.  
	list: prsim, ...

Trivial:
rename object files, eliminate 'art' from names
	also in Makefiles, purge ART from names.
