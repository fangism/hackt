"lib/compat/README"

This directory is named 'compat' so that scripts that are intended to assist
with tool/version migration to and from HAC can have a home.  

The scripts and files in this directory are contributed from external sources
and are NOT regularly tested, nor are they installed, though it is conceivable
that one might wish to install some of them, so we continue to distribute them.
To install them, copy them over yourself.

Use at your own risk.
But then again, the same goes for this entire project.
