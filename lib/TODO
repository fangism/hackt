Use configure to generate Makefiles suitable for installations of hackt.  
Distinguish between build Makefiles and install Makefiles.  

library catalog (documentation):
	Use doxygen to generate standard library documentation
	from the comments in the .hac sources.  Will probably have to
	emit 'fake' C/C++ sources for the sake of feeding doxygen 
	with a familiar input language.  This could be accomplished
	by the AST front-end as a translator.  
	(distribute the docs, auto-generation should be optional, 
		to eliminate user-dependency on doxygen, 
		may complicate distcheck a little.)

library additions:
	buffered logic family
		boolean logic
		arithmetic
		splits
		merges
	memory cells
	precharge skeletons
