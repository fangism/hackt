Use configure to generate Makefiles suitable for installations of hackt.  
Distinguish between build Makefiles and install Makefiles.  

file organization:
	push definitions into smaller files into subdirectories
	to avoid polluting the global "file namespace"
	which can cause unexpected including of files outside the library.  
	(If user names her file "channel.hac"...)

sub-language support:
	What the hell do we do about CHP-only libraries?
	How should we try to separate CHP libraries from PRS equivalents?
		Naming convention?

library catalog (documentation):
	Use doxygen to generate standard library documentation
	from the comments in the .hac sources.  Will probably have to
	emit 'fake' C/C++ sources for the sake of feeding doxygen 
	with a familiar input language.  This could be accomplished
	by the AST front-end as a translator.  
	(distribute the docs, auto-generation should be optional, 
		to eliminate user-dependency on doxygen, 
		may complicate distcheck a little.)

inline documentation:
	Ideally every comment preceding a definition should confirm
	that it is working by pointing to the relevant test cases
	in test/lib that demonstrate it (prsim with random timing for QDI).  
	The pointer to the test case is a certification.  
	Use embedded texinfo, and extract_texinfo.awk them!

library additions:
	buffered logic family
		boolean logic
		arithmetic
		splits
		merges
	memory cells
	precharge skeletons

	active-high/low bool-wrapper, useful for Resets.  
	so the direction of the a node is encoded as a type.
