This is the home directory of general library files.  
All files are architecture-independent.  

I'll write an install Makefile for this eventually.  

Contents of subdirectories:

mk: makefile templates, standard and automake-style
support: support files for 3rd party apps, like syntax highlighters
libchpfn: standard library of CHP run-time functions
